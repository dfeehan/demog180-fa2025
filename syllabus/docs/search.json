    "text": "Overview\nThe science of social networks focuses on measuring, modeling, and understanding the different ways that people are connected to one another. In this class, we will use a broad toolkit of theories and methods drawn from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to learn what a social network is, to understand how to work with social network data, and to illustrate some of the ways that social networks can be useful in theory and in practice. We will see that network ideas are powerful enough to be used everywhere from CDC and UNAIDS, where network models help epidemiologists prevent the spread of HIV, to Silicon Valley, where data scientists use network ideas to build products that enable people all across the globe to connect with one another.\nThis syllabus is not yet final, but is intended to give you a sense of what the class will cover.

    "section": "Requirements",
    "text": "Requirements\n\nLectures\nLectures will introduce and develop key theoretical and technical concepts in the study of social networks. To illustrate these ideas, some of the lectures will have a live lab component, where we will interactively discuss and work through an analysis in a Jupyter notebook. These live labs will help us explore and develop intuition about key concepts in the course.\nThe lectures are organized so that the first set of material, up to the mid-term exam, is a survey of the core theories, concepts, and methods needed to be familiar with social networks. After the mid-term, the lectures will turn to an exploration of how these core ideas have been used, modified, and deepened in several different topic areas.\nYou are responsible for all of the material covered in lectures, as well as any announcements made there.\n\n\nRequired readings\nThe course readings will include selections from the textbook Networks, Crowds, and Markets by Easley and Kleinberg:\n\nDavid Easley and Jon Kleinberg Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World (Cambridge University Press, 2010), https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/.\n\nWe will also read chapters from popular science books written by leading network researchers, including selections from\n\nD. J. Watts Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age (WW Norton & Company, 2003).\nHelen Epstein The Invisible Cure: Why We Are Losing the Fight Against AIDS in Africa (Macmillan, 2008).\n\nFinally, we will read several journal and newspaper articles.\nThe readings serve two purposes: (1) they provide an introduction and reference for key concepts that we will need to study social networks; (2) they illustrate how social network ideas get used in real world research and applications across many different disciplines. You are expected to do the reading before each class. Whenever possible, PDFs of the readings will be posted on the bCourses site.\n\n\nHomeworks and labs\nThere will be a total of 6 to 8 homework assignments and a similar number of labs. The homeworks and labs are a critical part of the learning you will do in this class: they give you an opportunity to explore the topics we cover in the readings and in lecture on your own. They also give you a chance to practice your writing and your data analysis and programming skills. Most homeworks and labs will ask you to provide some written arguments and to solve some problems by writing Python code in a Jupyter notebook. It can be helpful and educational to discuss the assignments with other students in the class, but (1) all of the work should be your own (i.e., you are not allowed to just copy code, answers, or arguments); (2) you should make a note of the names of the other students you worked with when handing your assignments in.\nLabs are graded based on effort; therefore, you can get full credit on a lab even if you do not get all of the answers right. Labs must be handed in on time for full credit.\nHomeworks are graded on correctness and must be handed in on time for full credit. However, we will drop the homework with the lowest score; thus, you can miss handing in one homework over the course of the semester without it affecting your grade.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two in-class closed book examinations. The mid-term examination will be held during normal class time in our normal classroom; the timing of this midterm will be designed to assess your mastery of the core concepts in social networks. The final will be held during the final exam period (see the date/time above). The final exam will be cumulative.\n\n\nQuizzes\nWe will post a small number (2-4) quizzes on bCourses over the semester. These quizzes will consist of 5-10 multiple choice questions; the goal of these quizzes will be to ensure that you are staying up to date with the reading and lecture materials covered in the class (including guest lectures).\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nComponent\n% of grade\n\n\n\n\nHomeworks (you can drop your lowest score)\n30\n\n\nLabs\n20\n\n\nMid-term exam\n20\n\n\nFinal exam\n25\n\n\nQuizzes\n5"

    "text": "Other class policies\nReligious Accommodations\nRequests to accommodate a student’s religious creed by scheduling tests or examinations at alternative times should be submitted directly to the instructor. Reasonable common sense, judgment and the pursuit of mutual goodwill should result in the positive resolution of scheduling conflicts. The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved.\nStatement on Academic Freedom\nBoth students and instructors have rights to academic freedom. Please respect the rights of others to express their points of view in the classroom.\nDSP Accommodations\nThe purpose of academic accommodations is to ensure that all students have a fair chance at academic success. Disability, or hardships such as basic needs insecurity, uncertain documentation and immigration status, medical and mental health concerns, pregnancy and parenting, significant familial distress, and experiencing sexual violence or harassment, can affect a student’s ability to satisfy particular course requirements. Students have the right to reasonable academic accommodations, without having to disclose personal information to instructors. For more information about accommodations, scheduling conflicts related to religious creed or extracurricular activities, please see the Academic Accommodations hub website.\nStudent Resources\nThe Student Learning Center provides a wide range of resources to promote learning and academic success for students. For information regarding these services, please consult the Student Learning Center Website: https://slc.berkeley.edu/\nClassroom Climate\nWe are all responsible for creating a learning environment that is welcoming, inclusive, equitable, and respectful. If you feel that these expectations are not being met, you can consult your instructor(s) or seek assistance from campus resources (see the Academic Accommodations website).\nAcademic Integrity\nThe high academic standard at the University of California, Berkeley, is reflected in each degree that is awarded. As a result, every student is expected to maintain this high standard by ensuring that all academic work reflects unique ideas or properly attributes the ideas to the original sources.\nThese are some basic expectations of students with regards to academic integrity:\n\nAny work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this course from this instructor.\nAll assignments must use “proper attribution,” meaning that you have identified the original source and extent or words or ideas that you reproduce or use in your assignment. This includes drafts and homework assignments!\nIf you are unclear about expectations, ask your instructor or GSI.\nDo not collaborate or work with other students on assignments or projects unless you have been given permission or instruction to do so."
