  abstract = {Summary Background Up-to-date evidence on levels and trends for age-sex-specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality is essential for the formation of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence across countries. Methods We estimated age-sex-specific all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For pathogen-specific causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we computed 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65{$\cdot$}3 years (UI 65{$\cdot$}0--65{$\cdot$}6) in 1990, to 71{$\cdot$}5 years (UI 71{$\cdot$}0--71{$\cdot$}9) in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47{$\cdot$}5 million (UI 46{$\cdot$}8--48{$\cdot$}2) to 54{$\cdot$}9 million (UI 53{$\cdot$}6--56{$\cdot$}3) over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute differences between countries decreased but relative differences increased. For women aged 25--39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20--49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative differences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10{$\cdot$}7\%, from 4{$\cdot$}3 million deaths in 1990 to 4{$\cdot$}8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21\%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions. Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex specific mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.

  abstract = {The lack of comprehensive, high-quality health data in developing nations creates a roadblock for combating the impacts of disease. One key challenge is understanding the health information needs of people in these nations. Without understanding people's everyday needs, concerns, and misconceptions, health organizations and policymakers lack the ability to effectively target education and programming efforts. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach that uses search data from individuals to uncover and gain insight into health information needs in Africa. We analyze Bing searches related to HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis from all 54 African nations. For each disease, we automatically derive a set of common search themes or topics, revealing a wide-spread interest in various types of information, including disease symptoms, drugs, concerns about breastfeeding, as well as stigma, beliefs in natural cures, and other topics that may be hard to uncover through traditional surveys. We expose the different patterns that emerge in health information needs by demographic groups (age and sex) and country. We also uncover discrepancies in the quality of content returned by search engines to users by topic. Combined, our results suggest that search data can help illuminate health information needs in Africa and inform discussions on health policy and targeted education efforts both on- and offline.},

  abstract = {Objective: To present and update available national and subnational estimates of injecting drug users (IDUs) in developing/transitional countries, and provide indicative estimates of gender and age distribution. Methods: Literature review of both grey and published literature including updates from previously reported estimates on estimates of IDU population and data sources giving age and gender breakdowns. The scope area was developing/transitional countries and the reference period was 1998--2005. Results: Estimates of IDU numbers were available in 105 countries and 243 subnational areas. The largest IDU populations were reported from Brazil, China, India, and Russia (0.8 m, 1.9 m, 1.1 m, and 1.6 m respectively). Subnational areas with the largest IDU populations (35 000--79 000) are: Warsaw (Poland); Barnadul, Irtkustk, Nizhny-Novgorod, Penza, Voronez, St Petersburg, and Volgograd (Russia); New Delhi and Mumbai (India); Jakarta (Indonesia), and Bangkok (Thailand). By region, Eastern Europe and Central Asia have the largest IDU prevalence (median 0.65\%) (min 0.3\%; max 2.2\%; Q1 0.79\%; Q3 1.74\%) followed by Asia and Pacific: 0.24\% (min 0.004\%; max 1.47\%; Q1 0.37\%; Q3 1.1\%). In the Middle East and Africa the median value equals 0.2\% (min 0.0003\%; max 0.35\%; Q1 0.09\%; Q3 0.26\%) and in Latin America and the Caribbean: 0.12\% (min 0.002\%; max 7.04\%; Q1 1.76\%; Q3 5.28\%). Greater dispersion of national IDU prevalences was observed in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Asia and Pacific (IQR 1.91 and 1.47 respectively). Subnational areas with the highest IDU prevalence among adults (8--14.9\%) were Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Balti (Moldova), Astrakhan, Barnadul, Irtkustk, Khabarovsk, Kaliningrad, Naberezhnyje Chelny, Penza, Togliatti, Volgograd, Voronez, and Yaroslavl (Russia), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Ashgabad (Turkmenistan), Ivano-Frankivsk and Pavlograd (Ukraine) and Imphal, Manipur (India). 66\% (297/447) of the IDU estimates were reported without technical information. Data on the IDU age/gender distributions are also scarce or unavailable for many countries. In 11 Eastern European and Central Asian countries the age group {$\leq$}20--29 represented {$>$}50\% of the total. The proportion of IDU men was 70\%--90\% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and there was a marked absence of data on women outside this region. Conclusion: Unfortunately data on IDU prevalence available to national and international policymakers is of an unknown and probably yet to be tested quality. This study provide baseline figures but steps need to be taken now to improve the reporting and assessment of these critical data.},

  abstract = {Introduction  Many national and subnational governments need to routinely measure the completeness of death registration for monitoring and statistical purposes. Existing methods, such as death distribution and capture-recapture methods, have a number of limitations such as inaccuracy and complexity that prevent widespread application. This paper presents a novel empirical method to estimate completeness of death registration at the national and subnational level. Methods  Random-effects models to predict the logit of death registration completeness were developed from 2,451 country-years in 110 countries from 1970--2015 using the Global Burden of Disease 2015 database. Predictors include the registered crude death rate, under-five mortality rate, population age structure and under-five death registration completeness. Models were developed separately for males, females and both sexes. Findings  All variables are highly significant and reliably predict completeness of registration across a wide range of registered crude death rates (R-squared 0.85). Mean error is highest at medium levels of observed completeness. The models show quite close agreement between predicted and observed completeness for populations outside the dataset. There is high concordance with the Hybrid death distribution method in Brazilian states. Uncertainty in the under-five mortality rate, assessed using the dataset and in Colombian departmentos, has minimal impact on national level predicted completeness, but a larger effect at the subnational level. Conclusions  The method demonstrates sufficient flexibility to predict a wide range of completeness levels at a given registered crude death rate. The method can be applied utilising data readily available at the subnational level, and can be used to assess completeness of deaths reported from health facilities, censuses and surveys. Its utility is diminished where the adult mortality rate is unusually high for a given under-five mortality rate. The method overcomes the considerable limitations of existing methods and has considerable potential for widespread application by national and subnational governments.},

On the email network we find that small world search strategies using a contact's position in physical space or in an organizational hierarchy relative to the target can effectively be used to locate most individuals. However, we find that in the online student network, where the data is incomplete and hierarchical structures are not well defined, local search strategies are less effective. We compare our findings to recent theoretical hypotheses about underlying social structure that would enable these simple search strategies to succeed and discuss the implications to social software design.},

Existing list experiment best practices aim to minimize strategic misrepresentation in ways that virtually guarantee that a tiny number of respondents appear in the extrema. Under such conditions both the ``no liars'' identification assumption and the computational strategy used to estimate the ICT-MLE become difficult to sustain. I report the results of Monte Carlo experiments examining the sensitivity of the ICT-MLE and simple difference-in-means estimators to survey design choices and small amounts of non-strategic respondent error. I show that, compared to the difference in means, the performance of the ICT-MLE depends on list design. Both estimators are sensitive to measurement error, but the problems are more severe for the ICT-MLE as a direct consequence of the no liars assumption. These problems become extreme as the number of treatment-group respondents choosing all the items on the list decreases. I document that such problems can arise in real-world applications, provide guidance for applied work, and suggest directions for further research.},

Design, settings and participants We conducted a follow-up study from 2003 to 2017 using data from Matlab HDSS, which covers a rural population of 0.24 million (in 2018) in Chandpur, Bangladesh. HDSS assessed the causes of all deaths using verbal autopsy and classified the causes using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases. We examined 19 327 deaths involving 2 279 237 person-years. Methods We calculated annual cause-specific mortality rates and estimated adjusted proportional HRs using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results All-cause mortality risk declined over the study period among people aged 15 and older, but the risk from stroke increased, and from heart disease and cancers remained unchanged. These causes were more common among middle-aged and older people and thus bore the most burden. Mortality from causes other than NCDs---namely, infectious and respiratory diseases, injuries, endocrine disorders and others---declined yet still constituted over 30\% of all deaths. Thus, the overall mortality decline was associated with the decline of causes other than NCDs. Mortality risk sharply increased with age. Men had higher mortality than women from heart disease, cancers and other causes, but not from stroke. Lower household wealth quintile people have higher mortality than higher household wealth quintile people, non-Muslims than Muslims. Conclusion Deaths from stroke, heart disease and cancers were either on the rise or remained unchanged, but other causes declined continuously from 2003 to 2017. Immediate strengthening of the preventive and curative healthcare systems for NCDs management is a burning need.},

  abstract = {Certain people occupy topological positions within social networks that enhance their effectiveness at inducing spillovers. We mapped face-to-face networks among 24,702 people in 176 isolated villages in Honduras and randomly assigned villages to targeting methods, varying the fraction of households receiving a 22-month health education package and the method by which households were chosen (randomly versus using the friendship-nomination algorithm). We assessed 117 diverse knowledge, attitude, and practice outcomes. Friendship-nomination targeting reduced the number of households needed to attain specified levels of village-wide uptake. Knowledge spread more readily than behavior, and spillovers extended to two degrees of separation. Outcomes that were intrinsically easier to adopt also manifested greater spillovers. Network targeting using friendship nomination effectively promotes population-wide improvements in welfare through social contagion.}

  abstract = {Social isolation is associated with higher mortality in studies comprising mostly white adults, yet associations among black adults are unclear. In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated whether associations of social isolation with all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality differed by race and sex. Adults enrolled in Cancer Prevention Study II in 1982/1983 were followed for mortality through 2012 (n = 580,182). Sex- and race-specific multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated for associations of a 5-point social isolation score with risk of death. Social isolation was associated with all-cause mortality in all subgroups (P for trend {$\leq$} 0.005); for the most isolated versus the least isolated, the hazard ratios were 2.34 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.58, 3.46) and 1.60 (95\% CI: 1.41, 1.82) among black men and white men, respectively (P for interaction = 0.40) and 2.13 (95\% CI: 1.44, 3.15) and 1.84 (95\% CI: 1.68, 2.01) among black women and white women, respectively (P for interaction = 0.89). The association did not differ between black men and black women (P for interaction = 0.33) but was slightly stronger in white women than in white men (P for interaction = 0.01). Social isolation was associated with cardiovascular disease mortality in each subgroup (P for trend \&lt; 0.03) but with cancer mortality only among whites (P for trend \&lt; 0.0001). Subgroup differences in the influence of specific social isolation components were identified. Identifying and intervening with socially isolated adults could improve health outcomes.}

  abstract = {Fertility is below replacement level in all European countries, and population growth is expected to decline in the coming decades. Increasing life expectancy will accentuate concomitant aging of the population. Migration has been seen as a possible means to decelerate aging. In this article, I introduce a stable, open-population model in which cohort net migration is proportional to births. In this case, the migration-fertility trade-off can be studied with particular ease. I show that although migration can increase the growth rate, which tends to make the age distribution younger, it also has an opposite effect because of its typical age pattern. I capture the effect of the age pattern of net migration in a migration-survivor function. The effect of net migration on growth is quantified with data from 17 European countries. I show that some countries already have a level of migration that will lead to stationarity. For other countries with asymptotically declining population, migration still provides opportunities for slowing down aging of the population as a whole.}

Country-specific MMR estimates are published on a regular basis by the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group (UN MMEIG) to track progress in reducing maternal deaths and were used to evaluate regional and national performance related to Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5, which called for a 75\% reduction in the MMR between 1990 and 2015. Until 2014, the UN MMEIG used a multilevel regression model for producing estimates for countries without sufficient data from vital registration systems. While this model worked well in the past to assess MMR levels for countries with limited data, it was deemed unsatisfactory for final MDG 5 reporting for countries where longer time series of observations had become available because, by construction, estimated trends in the MMR were covariate-driven only and did not necessarily track data-driven trends. We developed a Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model, which extends upon the UN MMEIG multilevel regression model. The new model assesses data-driven trends through the inclusion of an ARIMA time series model that captures accelerations and decelerations in the rate of change in the MMR. Varying reporting and data quality issues are accounted for in source-specific data models. The revised model provides data-driven estimates of MMR levels and trends and was used for MDG 5 reporting for all countries.},

We explore the effects of false-positive and false-negative error in egocentric networks on both standard network measures and on linear models through simulation analysis on a ground truth egocentric network sample based on facebook-friendships. Results show that 5--20\% error rates, which are consistent with error rates known to occur in ego network data, can cause serious misestimation of network properties and regression parameters.},

  abstract = {Evidence has become central for humanitarian decision making, as it is now commonly agreed that aid must be provided solely in proportion to the needs and on the basis of needs assessments. Still, reliable epidemiological data from conflict-affected communities are difficult to acquire in time for effective decisions, as existing health information systems progressively lose functionality with the onset of conflicts. In the last decade, health and nutrition humanitarian agencies have made substantial progress in collecting quality data using small-scale surveys. In 2002, a group of academics, non-governmental organizations, and UN agencies launched the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) methodology. Since then, field agencies have conducted thousands of surveys. Although the contribution of each survey by itself is limited by its small sample and the impossibility to extrapolate results to national level, their aggregation can provide a more stable view of both trends and distributions in a larger region. The Complex Emergency Database (CEDAT) was set up in order to make best use of the collective force of these surveys. Functioning as a central repository, it can provide valuable information on trends and patterns of mortality and nutrition indicators from conflict-affected communities. Given their high spatial resolution and their high frequency, CEDAT data can complement official statistics in between nationwide surveys. They also provide information of the displacement status of the measured population, pointing out vulnerabilities. CEDAT is hosted at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, University of Louvain. It runs on voluntary agreements between the survey implementer and the CEDAT team. To date, it contains 3309 surveys from 51 countries, and is a unique repository of such data.},

Individuals who appeared to be female or older adults had higher odds of using face coverings. Additionally, location-specific variables such as expensiveness of store, county-level population and county-level COVID-19 case prevalence were associated with increased odds of using face coverings. To our knowledge, this is the first direct observational study examining face covering behavior by the public in the U.S., and our findings have implications for public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In the case of tuberculosis (TB), the capabilities of epidemic models to produce quantitatively robust forecasts are limited by multiple hindrances. Among these, understanding the complex relationship between disease epidemiology and populations' age structure has been highlighted as one of the most relevant. TB dynamics depends on age in multiple ways, some of which are traditionally simplified in the literature. That is the case of the heterogeneities in contact intensity among different age strata that are common to all airborne diseases, but still typically neglected in the TB case. Furthermore, while demographic structures of many countries are rapidly aging, demographic dynamics are pervasively ignored when modeling TB spreading. In this work, we present a TB transmission model that incorporates country-specific demographic prospects and empirical contact data around a data-driven description of TB dynamics. Using our model, we find that the inclusion of demographic dynamics is followed by an increase in the burden levels predicted for the next decades in the areas of the world that are most hit by the disease today. Similarly, we show that considering realistic patterns of contacts among individuals in different age strata reshapes the transmission patterns reproduced by the models, a result with potential implications for the design of age-focused epidemiological interventions.},

  abstract = {The modeling of large-scale communicable epidemics has greatly benefited in the last years from the increasing availability of highly detailed data. Particullarly, in order to achieve quantitative descriptions of the evolution of epidemics, contact networks and mixing patterns are key. These heterogeneous patterns depend on several factors such as location, socioeconomic conditions, time, and age. This last factor has been shown to encapsulate a large fraction of the observed inter-individual variation in contact patterns, an observation validated by different measurements of age-dependent contact matrices. Recently, several works have studied how to project those matrices to areas where empirical data are not available. However, the dependence of contact matrices on demographic structures and their time evolution has been largely neglected. In this work, we tackle the problem of how to transform an empirical contact matrix that has been obtained for a given demographic structure into a different contact matrix that is compatible with a different demography. The methodology discussed here allows to extrapolate a contact structure measured in a particular area to any other whose demographic structure is known, as well as to obtain the time evolution of contact matrices as a function of the demographic dynamics of the populations they refer to. To quantify the effect of considering time-dynamics of contact patterns on disease modeling, we implemented a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model on 16 different countries and regions and evaluated the impact of neglecting the temporal evolution of mixing patterns. Our results show that simulated disease incidence rates, both at the aggregated and age-specific levels, are significantly dependent on contact structures variation driven by demographic evolution. The present work opens the path to eliminate technical biases from model-based impact evaluations of future epidemic threats and warns against the use of contact matrices to model diseases without correcting for demographic evolution or geographic variations.},

We examine rural-urban differences in mortality in 53 low- and middle-income countries. We consider how the rural-urban mortality gap evolves from birth to age 60 by estimating mortality based on birth and sibling histories from 138 Demographic and Health Surveys run between 1992 and 2018. We observe excess rural mortality until age 15, finding the largest differences between urban and rural sectors among 1-59-month-olds. While we cannot claim higher mortality among urban adults than those in rural areas, we find a reduced gap between the sectors over the life course and a diminishing urban advantage in adult mortality with age. This shift over the life course reflects a divergence in the epidemiologic transition between the rural and urban sectors.},

Aggregation corresponds to the reduction of the dimension of a dynamical system which is replaced by a smaller model for a small number of global variables at a slow timescale. We study the couplings between fast and slow dynamics leading to the emergence of global properties in the aggregated model. First, we study the case of a single population in a patchy environment. Growth rates are assumed to be linear on each patch. Individuals can migrate from one patch to another at a fast timescale. We choose different density dependent migration processes. In each case, we use aggregation methods to obtain the corresponding growth equation for the total density of the population at a slow timescale. We look for particular density dependent migration processes leading to an aggregated logistic-like equation. Second, we study the case of two interacting populations. A particular choice of density dependent migrations leads to an aggregated competition model.}

  abstract = {The widely-known Gompertz law of mortality states the exponential increase of mortality with age in human populations. Such an exponential increase is observed at the adulthood span, roughly after the reproductive period, while mortality data at young and extremely old ages deviate from it. The heterogeneity of human populations, i.e. the existence of subpopulations with different mortality dynamics, is a useful consideration that can explain age-dependent mortality patterns across the whole life-course. A simple mathematical model combining the heterogeneity of populations with an assumption that the mortality in each subpopulation grows exponentially with age has been proven to be capable of reproducing the entire mortality pattern in a human population including the observed peculiarities at early- and late-life intervals. In this work we fit this model to actual (Swedish) mortality data for consecutive periods and consequently describe the evolution of mortality dynamics in terms of the evolution of the model parameters over time. We have found that the evolution of the model parameters validates the applicability of the compensation law of mortality to each subpopulation separately. Furthermore, our study has indicated that the population structure changes so that the population tends to become more homogeneous over time. Finally, our analysis of the decrease of the overall mortality in a population over time has shown that this decrease is mainly due to a change in the population structure and to a lesser extent to a reduction of mortality in each of the subpopulations, the latter being represented by an alteration of the parameters that outline the exponential dynamics.},

Here we describe an experiment that is informative about the causes of mortality rate changes. By applying a brief, nondebilitating stress that increases mortality early in life and then observing subsequent mortality trajectories, it is possible to determine whether populations are heterogeneous for factors influencing mortality. We show that 24-h exposure to a desiccating air flow causes a spike and then a decrease in mortality rates in experimental populations compared to controls. If there is no stress-induced enhancement of vitality, then the results demonstrate the existence of heterogeneity for mortality rates in genetically homogeneous populations.},

  abstract = {While for pathogen clones singly occupying a host it may pay to adopt a relatively avirulent host exploitation strategy, clones sharing a host have a conflict of interest that favors more virulent strategies. As the number of infections per host depends on the force of infection and the force of infection, in turn, depends on prevailing virulence, evolutionary analysis needs to be integrated with population dynamics. A full-fledged approach requires exceedingly large capacities for bookkeeping of the infection events and is therefore difficult to establish. In this article the host-pathogen interaction is studied for the simple case in which hosts may become at most doubly infected. It appears that evolution and population dynamics give rise to a feedback mechanism. When double infections are frequent, increased virulence is favored; but when pathogens become more virulent, the force of infection will decrease, favoring lower virulence again. Thus, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) virulence depends on the interaction within hosts as well as on the interaction at the population level. As current models of host-microparasite interactions take only first infections into account, they may be inappropriate for evolutionary analyses, which would require modeling of within-host competition between strains and thus of multiple infections.},

The study involved concurrent think-aloud interviews, in which respondents were debriefed about their thought processes immediately after answering the name generator. Analyses of these responses indicate that some respondents had difficulty in specifying what was meant by the term ``important matters''; sizable minorities understood the question in terms of frequency of contact or intimacy rather than in terms of specific social exchanges. Most of those interviewed said that their ``important matters'' had to do with personal/intimate relationships or other issues of personal life (e.g., finances, hobbies, or health), but appreciable numbers referred to work and political discussions. An interview context experiment revealed that a respondent's definition of ``important matters'' can be shaped by the substantive content of the preceding parts of an interview schedule. Notwithstanding these findings, the composition of the networks elicited in the study does not appear to vary substantially across interpretations of the name generator. We conclude that the name generator succeeds in measuring ``core'' discussion networks, though with somewhat nonspecific content. Implications for the measurement of personal networks in sample surveys are discussed.},

  abstract = {Scientific fields operate within paradigms that define problems and solutions for a community of researchers. The dominant paradigm in polling centers on random sampling, which is unfortunate because random sampling is, for all practical purposes, dead. The pollsters who try to produce random samples fail because hardly anyone responds. And more and more pollsters do not even try. The field therefore has folded weighting-type adjustments into the paradigm, but this too is unfortunate because weighting works only if we assume away important threats to sampling validity, threats that loom particularly large in the growing nonprobability polling sector. This article argues that the polling field needs to move to a more general paradigm built around the equation that characterizes survey error for any sampling approach, including nonrandom samples. Moving to this new paradigm has two important benefits. First, this new paradigm elevates new insights, including the fact that survey error increases with population size when individuals' decisions to respond are correlated with how they respond. This insight helps us understand how small sampling defects can metastasize into large survey errors. Second, the new paradigm points the field toward new methods that more directly identify and account for sampling defects in a nonrandom sampling environment. This article describes the intuition and potential power of these new tools, tools that are further elaborated in .},

In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body  of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an  inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign  country. Given Facebook's scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook's user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

We also document significant heterogeneity in the geographic breadth of social networks across New York zip codes, and show that this heterogeneity correlates with access to public transit. Zip codes with geographically broader social networks also have higher incomes, higher education levels, and more high-quality entrepreneurial activity.

  abstract = {This article introduces Rcapture, an R package for capture-recapture experiments. The data for analysis consists of the frequencies of the observable capture histories over the t capture occasions of the experiment. A capture history is a vector of zeros and ones where one stands for a capture and zero for a miss. Rcapture can fit three types of models. With a closed population model, the goal of the analysis is to estimate the size N of the population which is assumed to be constant throughout the experiment. The estimator depends on the way in which the capture probabilities of the animals vary. Rcapture features several models for these capture probabilities that lead to different estimators for N. In an open population model, immigration and death occur between sampling periods. The estimation of survival rates is of primary interest. Rcapture can fit the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Jolly-Seber model to such data. The third type of models fitted by Rcapture are robust design models. It features two levels of sampling; closed population models apply within primary periods and an open population model applies between periods. Most models in Rcapture have a loglinear form; they are fitted by carrying out a Poisson regression with the R function glm. Estimates of the demographic parameters of interest are derived from the loglinear parameter estimates; their variances are obtained by linearization. The novel feature of this package is the provision of several new options for modeling capture probabilities heterogeneity between animals in both closed population models and the primary periods of a robust design. It also implements many of the techniques developed by R. M. Cormack for open population models.},

Using administrative data from a cash transfer experiment in Malawi and school attendance ledgers collected as part of the impact evaluation, we find that while all study participants overstate their enrollment and attendance rates, the extent to which this happens is significantly higher in the control group than the CCT arm. This finding implies that exclusive reliance on self-reported school participation data can lead to a serious underestimation of actual program impacts. We recommend that self-reports be supplemented using alternative sources of data on school participation that are appropriate to the experiment at hand --- even if such efforts are likely to increase evaluation costs.},

  abstract = {Many online experiments exhibit dependence between users and items. For example, in online advertising, observations that have a user or an ad in common are likely to be associated.   Because of this, even in experiments involving millions of subjects, the difference in mean outcomes between control and treatment conditions can have substantial variance. Previous theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that not accounting for this kind of dependence structure can result in confidence intervals that are too narrow, leading to inaccurate hypothesis tests. We develop a framework for understanding how dependence affects uncertainty in user--item experiments and evaluate how bootstrap methods that account for differing levels of dependence  perform in practice. We use three real datasets describing user behaviors on Facebook --- user responses to ads, search results, and News Feed stories --- to generate data for synthetic experiments in which there is no effect of the treatment on average by design. We then estimate empirical Type I error rates for each bootstrap method.  Accounting for dependence within a single type of unit (i.e., within-user dependence) is often sufficient to get reasonable error rates. But when experiments have effects, as one might expect in the field, accounting for multiple units with a multiway bootstrap can be necessary to get close to the advertised Type I error rates. This work provides guidance to practitioners evaluating large-scale experiments, and highlights the importance of analysis of inferential methods for dependence structures common to online systems.},

The first paradox is the simultaneous absence and presence of attitude polarization---the fact that global attitude polarization is relatively rare, even though pundits describe it as common. The second paradox is the simultaneous presence and absence of social polarization---the fact that while individuals experience attitude homogeneity in their interpersonal networks, their networks are characterized by attitude heterogeneity. These paradoxes give rise to numerous scholarly arguments. By developing a formal model of interpersonal influence over attitudes in a context where individuals hold simultaneous positions on multiple issues, we show why these arguments are not mutually exclusive and how they meaningfully refer to the same social setting. The results from this model provide a single parsimonious account for both paradoxes. The framework we develop may be generalized to a wider array of problems, including classic problems in collective action.},

Linkage failure may occur when databases are affected by missing or inaccurate information. In particular, if the subsets of those who are not linked are not representative of the original population, the results obtained from linked data may be biased. This paper discusses the impact of incomplete RL on survival analysis. Methods In our study we assess by simulations the potential impact of such bias, that we will refer to as RL, on the effect of the covariates in the Cox regression model. We also evaluate the RL bias introduced by an incomplete linkage procedure on the analysis of survival in a cohort of patients with breast cancer. Results Our simulation study shows that the relative bias of the factors, which the linking probability depends on, reaches the threshold of 20\%, and is never less than 5\%. The bias observed in the simulation for a comparable scenario is consistent with the actual one estimated from the breast cancer records. Conclusions Incomplete RL is rarely explicitly taken into account in the models for survival analysis. This study indicates that such a practice is potentially leading to inefficient and biased results, in particular in presence of medium or small sample sizes.},

We use a unique data set on individuals who placed matrimonial advertisements in a major newspaper, the responses they received, how they ranked them, and the eventual matches. We estimate the preferences for caste, education, beauty, and other attributes. We then compute a set of stable matches, which we compare to the actual matches that we observe in the data. We find the stable matches to be quite similar to the actual matches, suggesting a relatively frictionless marriage market. One of our key empirical findings is that there is a very strong preference for within-caste marriage. However, because both sides of the market share this preference and because the groups are fairly homogeneous in terms of the distribution of other attributes, in equilibrium, the cost of wanting to marry within-caste is low. This allows caste to remain a persistent feature of the Indian marriage market.}

We calibrate/estimate the model using contact survey data and data on weekly historical individual actions and non-pharmaceutical interventions in the weeks ending March 8 -- May 16, 2020. Going forward, we model a decision-maker (governor) as following reopening guidelines like those proposed by the White House and the CDC. The sectoral accounting, combined with information on personal proximity and ability to work from home by sector, make it possible to construct a GDP-to-Risk index of which sectors provide the greatest increment in GDP per marginal increase in R0. Through simulations, we find that: a strong economic reopening is possible; a ``smart'' reopening, preferencing some sectors over others, makes only modest improvements over a broad reopening; and all this hinges on retaining strong restrictions on non-work social contacts. If non-work contacts -- going to bars, shopping without social distancing and masks, large group gatherings, etc. -- return only half-way to the pre-COVID-19 baseline, the current decline in deaths reverses leading to a second wave of business closures.}

We investigate the dating of images using OpenCLIP, an open-source implementation of CLIP, a multi-modal language and vision model. Our experiment consists of three steps: zero-shot classification, fine-tuning, and analysis of visual content. We use the {\textbackslash}textit\{De Boer Scene Detection\} dataset, containing 39,866 gray-scale historical press photographs from 1950 to 1999. The results show that zero-shot classification is relatively ineffective for image dating, with a bias towards predicting dates in the past. Fine-tuning OpenCLIP with a logistic classifier improves performance and eliminates the bias. Additionally, our analysis reveals that images featuring buses, cars, cats, dogs, and people are more accurately dated, suggesting the presence of temporal markers. The study highlights the potential of machine learning models like OpenCLIP in dating images and emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning for accurate temporal analysis. Future research should explore the application of these findings to color photographs and diverse datasets.},

In this article, I show that the structure of the social networks in which they are embedded can be a source of information about their ideological positions. Under the assumption that social networks are homophilic, I develop a Bayesian Spatial Following model that considers ideology as a latent variable, whose value can be inferred by examining which politics actors each user is following. This method allows us to estimate ideology for more actors than any existing alternative, at any point in time and across many polities. I apply this method to estimate ideal points for a large sample of both elite and mass public Twitter users in the United States and five European countries. The estimated positions of legislators and political parties replicate conventional measures of ideology. The method is also able to successfully classify individuals who state their political preferences publicly and a sample of users matched with their party registration records. To illustrate the potential contribution of these estimates, I examine the extent to which online behavior during the 2012 US presidential election campaign is clustered along ideological lines.},

Research demonstrates a strong correspondence between the issues about which the public cares and the issues addressed by politicians, but conclusive evidence about who leads whom in setting the political agenda has yet to be uncovered. We answer this question with fine-grained temporal analyses of Twitter messages by legislators and the public during the 113th US Congress. After employing an unsupervised method that classifies tweets sent by legislators and citizens into topics, we use vector autoregression models to explore whose priorities more strongly predict the relationship between citizens and politicians. We find that legislators are more likely to follow, than to lead, discussion of public issues, results that hold even after controlling for the agenda-setting effects of the media. We also find, however, that legislators are more likely to be responsive to their supporters than to the general public.},

Findings indicate that metropolises and regional urban centers, mainly those in the Southeast, play an important role in the spread of the epidemic, not only because of their population density but also because they are centers of trade and social interaction. In smaller cities located in the state of S{\~a}o Paulo, a large number of AIDS cases among injecting drug users are concentrated, revealing the routes and centers of cocaine use.},

Of the twenty-four other common causes of death only bronchitis, stomach cancer, and rheumatic heart disease were similarly related to infant mortality. These diseases are associated with poor living conditions and mortality from them is declining. Ischaemic heart disease is strongly correlated with both neonatal and postneonatal mortality. It is suggested that poor nutrition in early life increases susceptibility to the effects of an affluent diet.}

We show that the growth of the epidemic prevalence is virtually instantaneous in all networks characterized by diverging degree fluctuations, independently of the structure of the connectivity correlation functions characterizing the population network. By means of analytical and numerical results, we show that the outbreak time evolution follows a precise hierarchical dynamics. Once reached the most highly connected hubs, the infection pervades the network in a progressive cascade across smaller degree classes. Finally, we show the influence of the initial conditions and the relevance of statistical results in single case studies concerning heterogeneous networks. The emerging theoretical framework appears of general interest in view of the recently observed abundance of natural networks with complex topological features and might provide useful insights for the development of adaptive strategies aimed at epidemic containment.},

We address this issue with a new model of legislative effectiveness that formalizes the role of social connections, and we test its predictions using the network of cosponsorship links in the 109th--113th Congresses. We propose a new empirical strategy that addresses network endogeneity by implementing a two-step Heckman correction based on an original instrument: the legislators' alumni connections. We find that social connections are a significant determinant of legislative effectiveness. We also study the influence of legislators' characteristics in shaping the network effects. In doing so, we provide new insights into how social connectedness interacts with factors such as seniority, partisanship, and legislative leadership in determining legislators' effectiveness.},

The model is derived from an underlying stochastic process of partnership network formation and disease transmission. The model is analysed numerically, and the final size and time evolution are considered for various levels of concurrency, as measured by the concurrency index K3 of Kretzschmar and Morris. Additionally, a new way of calculating R0 for spatial network models is developed. It is found that concurrency significantly increases R0 and the final size of a sexually transmitted disease, with some interesting exceptions.},

A second identification strategy exploits a quasi-experiment in East Germany created by a mistaken technology choice of the state-owned telecommunication provider in the 1990s that hindered broadband Internet roll-out for many households.

  abstract = {Aggregate relational data (ARD) on relationships between individuals and subgroups have been informative for studying egocentric network size and degree distributions, assessing segregation in contact with subpopulations, and estimating the size of unlisted groups. Scale-up models for ARD usually assume survey data giving counts of acquaintances in subpopulations, but a closed-ended response format that asks respondents to select a category covering a range of counts may be less burdensome. The simplest (dichotomous) such format distinguishes between having one or more acquaintances in a subpopulation and having none; many existing position generator data take this form. We assess the potential of dichotomous ARD by adapting existing methods for inference from count ARD to accommodate such data. We find that they permit estimation of degree distributions for basic scale-up models, though estimates are less precise than those from count ARD. Dichotomous ARD do not contain sufficient information to model segregation, however. These limitations may be addressed by estimating segregation using respondent heterogeneity on observed covariates, and/or by using a slightly expanded closed response format (0, 1, or two or more acquaintances). Our results suggest how the applications of position generator data -- which typically collect dichotomous ARD -- might be broadened to encompass questions studied using ARD.},

We show that half the people who report not talking about anything have nothing to talk about, whereas the others have no one to talk to. Secondly, we show that people tend to talk about things that many would regard as unimportant, for example, cloning of headless frogs, eating less red meat, and so on. Given this, the connection between characteristics of discussion networks and achievement of instrumental ends --- for example, getting a job or enhancing social support --- is tenuous. Finally, we show that there is substantial topic-alter dependency. This dependency suggests that many substantive findings reported about, for example, gender differences in network composition might be an artifact of the data-collection instrument. Micro-level topic-alter dependencies reflect macro-level associations between attributes, topics, and roles. Consequently, cross-cultural comparison of GSS network questions is problematic. Solutions for escaping these methodological dilemmas are proposed.},

Dans le cadre de cette th{\`e}se, nous analysons la situation d{\'e}mographique des centenaires qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois depuis le d{\'e}but du 20e si{\`e}cle {\`a} partir de donn{\'e}es agr{\'e}g{\'e}es (donn{\'e}es de recensement, statistiques de l'{\'e}tat civil, estimations de population).

Cette th{\`e}se se compose de trois articles.  Dans le cadre du premier, nous traitons de l'{\'e}volution du nombre de centenaires au Qu{\'e}bec depuis les ann{\'e}es 1920.  Sur la base d'indicateurs d{\'e}mographiques tels le ratio de centenaires, les probabilit{\'e}s de survie et l'{\^a}ge maximal moyen au d{\'e}c{\`e}s, nous mettons en lumi{\`e}re les progr{\`e}s remarquables qui ont {\'e}t{\'e} r{\'e}alis{\'e}s en mati{\`e}re de survie aux grands {\^a}ges.  Nous proc{\'e}dons {\'e}galement {\`a} la d{\'e}composition des facteurs responsables de l'augmentation du nombre de centenaires au Qu{\'e}bec.  Ainsi, au sein des facteurs identifi{\'e}s, l'augmentation de la probabilit{\'e} de survie de 80  {\`a} 100 ans s'inscrit comme principal d{\'e}terminant de l'accroissement du nombre de centenaires qu{\'e}b{\'e}cois.  Le deuxi{\`e}me article traite de la validation des {\^a}ges au d{\'e}c{\`e}s des centenaires des g{\'e}n{\'e}rations 1870-1894 d'origine canadienne-fran{\c c}aise et de confession catholique n{\'e}s et d{\'e}c{\'e}d{\'e}s au Qu{\'e}bec. Au terme de ce processus de validation, nous pouvons affirmer que les donn{\'e}es qu{\'e}b{\'e}coises aux grands {\^a}ges sont d'excellente qualit{\'e}.  Les trajectoires de mortalit{\'e} des centenaires bas{\'e}es sur les donn{\'e}es brutes s'av{\`e}rent donc repr{\'e}sentatives de la r{\'e}alit{\'e}.  L'{\'e}volution des quotients de mortalit{\'e} {\`a} partir de 100 ans t{\'e}moigne de la d{\'e}c{\'e}l{\'e}ration de la mortalit{\'e}.  Autant chez les hommes que chez les femmes, les quotients de mortalit{\'e} plafonnent aux alentours de 45\%.  	Finalement, dans le cadre du troisi{\`e}me article, nous nous int{\'e}ressons {\`a} la composante familiale de la long{\'e}vit{\'e}.  Nous comparons la survie des fr{\`e}res, s{\oe}urs et parents des semi-supercentenaires d{\'e}c{\'e}d{\'e}s entre 1995 et 2004 {\`a} celle de leurs cohortes de naissance respectives.  Les diff{\'e}rences de survie entre les fr{\`e}res, s{\oe}urs et parents des semi-supercentenaires sous observation et leur g{\'e}n{\'e}ration << contr{\^o}le >> s'av{\`e}rent statistiquement significatives {\`a} un seuil de 0,01\%.  De plus, les fr{\`e}res, s{\oe}urs, p{\`e}res et m{\`e}res des semi-supercentenaires ont entre 1,7 (s{\oe}urs) et 3 fois (m{\`e}res) plus de chance d'atteindre 90 ans que les membres de leur cohorte de naissance correspondante.

  abstract = {When estimating model parameters from survey data, two sources of variability should normally be taken into account for inference purposes: the model that is assumed to have generated data of the finite population, and the sampling design. If the overall sampling fraction is negligible, the model variability can in principle be ignored and bootstrap techniques that track only the sampling design variability can be used. They are typically implemented by producing design bootstrap weights, often assuming that primary sampling units are selected with replacement. The model variability is often neglected in practice, but this simplification is not always appropriate. Indeed, we provide simulation results for stratified simple random sampling showing that the use of design bootstrap weights may lead to substantial underestimation of the total variance, even when finite population corrections are ignored. We propose a generalized bootstrap method that corrects this deficiency through a simple adjustment of design bootstrap weights that accounts for the model variability. We focus on models in which the observations are assumed to be mutually independent but we do not require the validity of any assumption about their model variance. The improved performance of our proposed generalized bootstrap weights over design bootstrap weights is illustrated by means of a simulation study. Our methodology is also applied to data from the Aboriginal Children Survey conducted by Statistics Canada.},

Research has illuminated the personal calculus of voting, but the social calculus has received little attention since the 1940s. This study expands our understanding of the social influences on individual choice by examining the relationship of partisan biases in media, organizational, and interpersonal intermediaries to the voting choices of Americans. Its results show that the traditional sources of social influence still dominate: Interpersonal discussion outweighs the media in affecting the vote. Media effects appear to be the product of newspaper editorial pages rather than television or newspaper reporting, which contain so little perceptible bias that they often are misperceived as hostile. Parties and secondary organizations also are influential, but only for less interested voters-who are more affected by social contexts in general. Overall, this study demonstrates that democratic citizens are embedded in social contexts that join with personal traits in shaping their voting decisions.}

Due to survey logistics, agricultural data are usually collected by asking respondents to recall the details of events occurring during past agricultural seasons, potentially leading to recall bias. The problem is further complicated when interviews are conducted over the course of several months, thus leading to recall of variable length. To test for recall bias, the length of time between harvest and interview is examined for three African countries with respect to several common agricultural input and harvest measures. The analysis shows little evidence of large recall bias impacting data quality. There is some indication that more salient events are less subject to recall decay. Overall, the results allay some concerns about the quality of some types of agricultural data collected through recall over lengthy periods.},

  abstract = {When humans assemble into face-to-face social networks, they create an extended social environment that permits exposure to the microbiome of others, thereby shaping the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels1--6. Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,787 adults within 18 isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Furthermore, strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections, suggesting the relevance of a person's broader network. We also observe that socially central people are more microbially similar to the overall village than socially peripheral~people. Among 301 people whose microbiome was re-measured 2\,years later, we observe greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus otherwise similar unconnected co-villagers. Clusters of species and strains occur within clusters of people in village social networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.},

  abstract = {Although induced abortion is common, measurement issues have long made this area of research challenging. The current analysis applies an indirect method known as the list experiment to try to improve survey-based measurement of induced abortion. We added a double list experiment to a population-based survey of reproductive age women in Rajasthan, India and compared resulting abortion estimates to those we obtained via direct questioning in the same sample. We then evaluated list experiment assumptions. The final sample completing the survey consisted of 6,035 women. Overall, 1.8 percent of the women reported a past abortion via the list experiment questions, whereas 3.5 percent reported an abortion via the direct questions, and this difference was statistically significant. As such, the list experiment failed to produce more valid estimates of this sensitive behavior on a population-based survey of reproductive age women in Rajasthan, India. One explanation for the poor list experiment performance is our finding that key assumptions of the methodology were violated. Women may have mentally enumerated the treatment list items differently from the way they enumerated control list items. Further research is required to determine whether researchers can learn enough about how the list experiment performs in different contexts to effectively and consistently leverage its potential benefits to improve measurement of induced abortion.},

  abstract = {Background           Survival to old ages is increasing in many African countries. While demographic tools for estimating mortality up to age 60 have improved greatly, mortality patterns above age 60 rely on models based on little or no demographic data. These estimates are important for social planning and demographic projections. We provide direct estimations of older-age mortality using survey data.                             Methods           Since 2005, nationally representative household surveys in ten sub-Saharan countries record counts of living and recently deceased household members: Burkina Faso, C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. After accounting for age heaping using multiple imputation, we use this information to estimate probability of death in 5-year intervals (5qx). We then compare our 5qx estimates to those provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) to estimate the differences in mortality estimates, especially among individuals older than 60 years old.                             Findings           We obtained information on 505,827 individuals (18.4\% over age 60, 1.64\% deceased). WHO and UNPD mortality models match our estimates closely up to age 60 (mean difference in probability of death -1.1\%). However, mortality probabilities above age 60 are lower using our estimations than either WHO or UNPD. The mean difference between our sample and the WHO is 5.9\% (95\% CI 3.8--7.9\%) and between our sample is UNPD is 13.5\% (95\% CI 11.6--15.5\%). Regardless of the comparator, the difference in mortality estimations rises monotonically above age 60.                             Interpretation           Mortality estimations above age 60 in ten African countries exhibit large variations depending on the method of estimation. The observed patterns suggest the possibility that survival in some African countries among adults older than age 60 is better than previously thought. Improving the quality and coverage of vital information in developing countries will become increasingly important with future reductions in mortality.}

  abstract = {Respondent driven sampling (RDS) is an approach to sampling design utilizing the networks of social relationships that connect members of the target population to facilitate sampling by chain referral methods. Although this leads to biased sampling (such as over-sampling participants with many acquaintances), most RDS studies typically measure each participant's degree, and under the fundamental RDS assumption (that the probability to sample an individual is proportional to his degree) use inverse-probability weighting in an attempt to correct for this bias. However, this assumption is tenuous at best, and should be avoided. Here we suggest a completely novel approach for inference in RDS which compensates for such problems by using a rich source of information that is usually ignored - the precise timing of recruitment. Our new approach, adapting methods developed for inference in epidemic processes, also allows us to develop new estimators for properties such as the prevalence of a disease and the total population size, as well as to test the assumption of recruitment proportional to degree. We find these estimators asymptotically consistent and normally distributed. This new approach thus has the potential to greatly improve the utility of data collected using RDS.},

  abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0812647106 Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e., are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-relevant cultural products that are adopted quickly tend to be less successful overall (i.e., reduced cumulative adoption). These results suggest a potential alternate way to explain diffusion patterns that are traditionally seen as driven by saturation of a pool of potential adopters. They also shed light on one factor that may lead cultural tastes to die out.},

Specifically, using more than 100 years of first-names data, we examined how a name's popularity is influenced by the popularity of that name's component phonemes in other names in the previous year. Building on mere-exposure research, we found that names are more likely to become popular when similar names have been popular recently. These effects are nonlinear, however, and overpopularity hurts adoption. In addition, these effects vary with phoneme position. We demonstrate the causal impact of similarity on cultural success in a natural experiment using hurricane names. An exogenous shock to a phoneme's frequency, due to the presence of the phoneme in the names of prominent hurricanes, boosts the popularity of names that share that phoneme. Taken together, our results suggest how the similarity between cultural items affects how popular they become and how culture evolves more broadly.},

The association between social ties and mortality was found to be independent of self-reported physical health status at the time of the 1965 survey, year of death, socioeconomic status, and health practices such as smoking, alcoholic beverage consumption, obesity, physical activity, and utilization of preventive health services as well as a cumulative index of health practices.},

Such a multigraph models a communication or transportation network. A multiedge joining vertices u and v represents a direct communication (transportation) link between u and v, and the edges of the multiedge represent potential communications (transportations) between u and v over a fixed period of time. For a, b {$\epsilon$} V, and k a nonnegative integer, we say that N is k-failure ab-invulnerable for the time period [0, t] if information can be relayed from a to b within that time period, even if up to k edges are deleted, i.e., ``fail.'' The k-failure ab-vulnerability threshold {$\nu$}ab(k) is the earliest time t such that N is k-failure ab-invulnerable for the time period [0, t] [where {$\nu$}ab(k) = {$\infty$} if no such t exists]. Let {$\kappa$} denote the smallest k such that {$\nu$}ab(k) = {$\infty$}. In this paper, we present an O({$\kappa\vert$}E{\textbar}) algorithm for computing {$\nu$}ab(i), i = 0, {\dots}, {$\kappa$} -1. The latter algorithm constructs a set of {$\kappa$} pairwise edge-disjoint schedule-conforming paths P0, {\dots}, P{$\kappa$} -1 such that the finish time of Pi is {$\nu$}ab(i), i = 0, 1, {\dots}, {$\kappa$} -1. (A path P = ae1u1e2 {$\cdot\cdot\cdot$} Upp-1epb is schedule-conforming if the finish time of edge ei is no greater than the start time of the next edge ei + 1.) The existence of such paths when {$\alpha$}(e) = {$\beta$}(e) = 0, for all e {$\epsilon$} E, implies Menger's Theorem. In this paper, we also show that the obvious analogs of these results for either multiedge deletions or vertex deletions do not hold. In fact, we show that the problem of finding k schedule-conforming paths such that no two paths pass through the same vertex (multiedge) is NP-complete, even for k = 2. {\copyright} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

In spite of the enthusiastic rhetoric about the so called collective intelligence unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories---e.g., chemtrails, reptilians or the Illuminati---are pervasive in online social networks (OSN). In this work we study, on a sample of 1.2 million of individuals, how information related to very distinct narratives---i.e. main stream scientific and conspiracy news---are consumed and shape communities on Facebook. Our results show that polarized communities emerge around distinct types of contents and usual consumers of conspiracy news result to be more focused and self-contained on their specific contents. To test potential biases induced by the continued exposure to unsubstantiated rumors on users' content selection, we conclude our analysis measuring how users respond to 4,709 troll information---i.e. parodistic and sarcastic imitation of conspiracy theories. We find that 77.92\% of likes and 80.86\% of comments are from users usually interacting with conspiracy stories.},

The number of recorded contacts was significantly (P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}01) greater on workdays (18{$\cdot$}1) vs. weekend days (12{$\cdot$}3) for conversations, and vice versa for touching (5{$\cdot$}4 and 7{$\cdot$}2 respectively). Mixing was highly assortative with age for both (adults contacting other adults vs. 0- to 5-year-olds, odds ratio 8{$\cdot$}9--10{$\cdot$}8). Respondents shared a closed environment significantly more often with {$>$}20 other adults than with {$>$}20 children. The difference in number of contacts per day was non-significant between self-evaluation and diary (P=0{$\cdot$}619 for conversations, P=0{$\cdot$}125 for touching).

There is still a paucity of population-based data on adult mortality for nearly all countries in the region. Using data from recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of six countries and one in-depth DHS, this paper examines the use of sibling histories to directly estimate rates of adult mortality. The countries studied include Uganda, Zambia, Central African Republic, C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Tanzania. Rates of adult male and female mortality are presented at the national level in comparison to estimates obtained from other published sources, where available, and for subnational areas where cohort and other mortality studies have been recently conducted. The results indicate surprising consistency with external data and, on the whole, underscore the expected but hitherto only sparsely documented association between residence in high HIV-prevalence areas and sharply elevated mortality risk during the relevant adult ages.The cases of Zambia and Uganda in particular provide clear evidence of very high adult mortality levels among both men and women. In general, the findings of the study demonstrate that DHS-type sibling histories represent a promising, relatively untapped source of data that will add to our understanding of adult mortality dynamics in Africa.The paper discusses some of the advantages and potential limitations of the data and derived mortality estimates.}

High-speed Internet promotes the use of electronic devices, video games and Internet addiction (e.g., online games and cyberloafing). Exposure to artificial light from tablets and PCs can alterate individuals' sleep patterns. However, there is little empirical evidence on the causal relationship between technology use near bedtime and sleep. This paper studies the causal effects of access to high-speed Internet on sleep. We first show that playing video games, using PC or smartphones, watching TV or movies are correlated with shorter sleep duration. Second, we exploit historical differences in pre-existing telephone infrastructure that affected the deployment of high-speed Internet across Germany (see Falck et~al., 2014) to identify a source of plausibly exogenous variation in access to Broadband. Using this instrumental variable strategy, we find that access to high-speed Internet (DSL) access reduces sleep duration and sleep satisfaction. Results are driven by individuals who face work or family time constraints.},

Using German panel data, we test whether the availability of broadband influences fertility choices in a low-fertility setting well known for the difficulty in combining work and family life. We exploit a strategy devised by Falck and colleagues to obtain causal estimates of the impact of broadband on fertility. We find positive effects of broadband availability on the fertility of highly educated women aged 25--45. We further confirm this result using county-level data on total fertility. We show that broadband access significantly increases the share of women reporting home- or part-time working. Furthermore, we find positive effects on time spent with children and overall life satisfaction. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that access to broadband allows highly educated women, but not the less educated, to reconcile career and motherhood, which may promote a `digital divide' in fertility.},

With an upsurge in violence in Colombia beginning in the late 1990s, Colombians fled in increasing numbers to Ecuador, especially to Sucumbios in the Ecuadorian Amazon, an area of extraordinary biodiversity. These migrants comprise both asylumseekers and traditional economic migrants. Despite the large influx, they still constitute a tiny part of the Ecuadorian population, creating the need to use 'rare elements' sampling methods. A household survey was carried out in 2006 in the five provinces found (2001 census) to have the largest proportion of Colombians. The main probability sample was supplemented by a snowball sample, with problems encountered described, and lessons learned. Key findings are summarised, comparing Colombians migrating to Ecuador voluntarily and involuntarily. Environmental effects of these migrants are minimal as most move to urban areas.}

I propose a modified version of MRP that replaces the multilevel model with a nonparametric approach called Bayesian additive regression trees (BART or, when combined with post-stratification, BARP).

We demonstrate that when carefully designed and analyzed, the two survey experiments can produce substantively similar empirical findings. Such agreement is shown to be possible even when these experiments are applied to one of the most challenging research environments: contemporary Afghanistan. We find that both experiments uncover similar patterns of support for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) among Pashtun respondents.

The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other ``diagnosands.'' Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement the proposed approach.},

This method asks respondents to use a randomization device, such as a coin flip, whose outcome is unobserved by the interviewer. By introducing random noise, the method conceals individual responses and protects respondent privacy. While numerous methodological advances have been made, we find surprisingly few applications of this promising survey technique. In this article, we address this gap by (1) reviewing standard designs available to applied researchers, (2) developing various multivariate regression techniques for substantive analyses, (3) proposing power analyses to help improve research designs, (4) presenting new robust designs that are based on less stringent assumptions than those of the standard designs, and (5) making all described methods available through open-source software. We illustrate some of these methods with an original survey about militant groups in Nigeria.},

We address this problem by providing new tools for diagnosing and mitigating measurement error in list experiments. First, we demonstrate that the nonlinear least squares regression (NLSreg) estimator proposed in Imai (2011) is robust to nonstrategic measurement error. Second, we offer a general model misspecification test to gauge the divergence of the MLreg and NLSreg estimates. Third, we show how to model measurement error directly, proposing new estimators that preserve the statistical efficiency of MLreg while improving robustness. Last, we revisit empirical studies shown to exhibit nonstrategic measurement error, and demonstrate that our tools readily diagnose and mitigate the bias. We conclude this article with a number of practical recommendations for applied researchers. The proposed methods are implemented through an open-source software package.},

The resulting bias is commonly referred to as social desirability bias, a subset of what we label sensitivity bias. We make three contributions. First, we propose a social reference theory of sensitivity bias to structure expectations about survey responses on sensitive topics. Second, we explore the bias-variance trade-off inherent in the choice between direct and indirect measurement technologies. Third, to estimate the extent of sensitivity bias, we meta-analyze the set of published and unpublished list experiments (a.k.a., the item count technique) conducted to date and compare the results with direct questions. We find that sensitivity biases are typically smaller than 10 percentage points and in some domains are approximately zero.},

The three sorts of information about nodes' positions that are usually used---which we refer to as ``nodal statistics''---are the paths from a given node to other nodes, the walks from a given node to other nodes, and the geodesics between other nodes that include a given node. Using such statistics on nodes' positions, we also characterize the types of trees such that centrality measures all agree, and we also discuss the properties that identify some path-based centrality measures.},

Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.},

If researchers do not weight when appropriate, they risk having biased estimates. Alternatively, when they unnecessarily apply weights, they can create an inefficient estimator without reducing bias. Yet in practice researchers rarely test the necessity of weighting and are sometimes guided more by the current practice in their field than by scientific evidence. In addition, statistical tests for weighting are not widely known or available. This article reviews empirical tests to determine whether weighted analyses are justified. We focus on regression models, though the review's implications extend beyond regression. We find that nearly all weighting tests fall into two categories: difference in coefficients tests and weight association tests. We describe the distinguishing features of each category, present their properties, and explain the close relationship between them. We review the simulation evidence on their sampling properties in finite samples. Finally, we highlight the unanswered theoretical and practical questions that surround these tests and that deserve further research.},

  abstract = {Background Realistic models of disease transmission incorporating complex population heterogeneities require input from quantitative population mixing studies. We use contact diaries to assess the relative importance of social settings in respiratory pathogen spread using three measures of person contact hours (PCH) as proxies for transmission risk with an aim to inform bipartite network models of respiratory pathogen transmission. Methods and Findings Our survey examines the contact behaviour for a convenience sample of 65 adults, with each encounter classified as occurring in a work, retail, home, social, travel or ``other'' setting. The diary design allows for extraction of PCH-interaction (cumulative time in face-face conversational or touch interaction with contacts) -- analogous to the contact measure used in several existing surveys -- as well as PCH-setting (product of time spent in setting and number of people present) and PCH-reach (product of time spent in setting and number of people in close proximity). Heterogeneities in day-dependent distribution of risk across settings are analysed using partitioning and cluster analyses and compared between days and contact measures. Although home is typically the highest-risk setting when PCH measures isolate two-way interactions, its relative importance compared to social and work settings may reduce when adopting a more inclusive contact measure that considers the number and duration of potential exposure events. Conclusions Heterogeneities in location-dependent contact behaviour as measured by contact diary studies depend on the adopted contact definition. We find that contact measures isolating face-face conversational or touch interactions suggest that contact in the home dominates, whereas more inclusive contact measures indicate that home and work settings may be of higher importance. In the absence of definitive knowledge of the contact required to facilitate transmission of various respiratory pathogens, it is important for surveys to consider alternative contact measures.},

  abstract = {This study reviews trends in interprovincial migration in Italy over the last 40 years, with reference to the mobility transition model. The overall intensity of interprovincial migration declined significantly in the mid-1970s. Subsequently there has been a slow decline, and at the beginning of the 1990s interprovincial mobility reached a level of about 10 moves per 1000 persons per year. This paper provides a description and interpretation of these migration patterns, using population register data at the provincial scale. The regional patterns of interprovincial migration were very pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s, and characterised by rural to urban and South to North migration. After more balanced geographical patterns in the mid-1970s, the demographic efficiency of interprovincial migrations indicates a rise in short-distance moves in the case of suburban migrations, and renewed South to North migrations. These changes in the regional patterns of interprovincial migration were closely related to the economic and social transformations in Italy since the 1950s. Special attention is given to the role of the metropolitan provinces: Rome, Milan, Naples and Turin. These provinces serve as centres of attraction and distribution of interprovincial migration flows, and the changes observed for these four provinces over the study period aid the understanding of the overall changes in the national migration system.

In our method a characteristic of the population is estimated by the average value of the characteristic over a class of empirical populations constructed from the sample. Our method extends that of Gross to situations in which the stratum sizes are not integer multiples of their respective sample sizes. Moreover, we show that our method can be used to generate second-order correct confidence intervals for smooth functions of population means, a property that has not been established for other resampling methods suggested in the literature. A second resampling method is proposed that also leads to second-order correct confidence intervals and is less computationally intensive than our bootstrap. But a simulation study reveals that the second method can be quite unstable in some situations, whereas our bootstrap performs very well.}

  abstract = {Objectives.~ ---To evaluate the various survey methods used in Somalia between 1991 and early 1993 while assessing documentation of mortality and malnutrition rates and common causes of morbidity and mortality.Data Sources. ---Twenty-three population surveys were identified from the Center for Public Health Surveillance for Somalia, the United Nations Children's Fund, and other humanitarian organizations.Study Selection. ---Only surveys with defined populations and apparently systematic methodology that focused on mortality, morbidity, and/or nutritional status were included.Results. ---Extensive methodological differences were found among the 23 surveys. Target populations and sampling strategies varied widely. Twelve studies were considered not reproducible. Of the 16 studies assessing mortality, only eight assessed cause of death. Use of units of measurement and inclusion of denominators in rate calculations were inconsistent. None of the studies provided confidence intervals around the point estimates of the rates. Of the 11 studies providing information on morbidity, none provided case definitions. And in the 16 studies reporting nutritional status, a variety of measurement methods and definitions of malnutrition were used. Three studies presented information based on midupper-arm circumference measurements, and 10 presented weight-for-height data below 70\% and 80\% of the reference median; only four studies presented z scores.Conclusions. ---While the results of some studies may have influenced policy and program management decisions, their effects may have been limited by failure to adequately document results and by differences among studies in objectives, design, parameters measured, methods of measurement, definitions, and analysis methods. We recommend that agencies conducting population studies in emergency situations define clear study objectives, use standard sampling and data collection methods, and ensure precise written documentation of study objectives, methods, and results.(JAMA. 1994;272:371-376)}

  abstract = {This paper proposes a measure of the contribution of unequal opportunities to earnings inequality. Drawing on the distinction between ``circumstance'' and ``effort'' variables in John Roemer's work on equality of opportunity, we associate inequality of opportunities with five observed circumstances which lie beyond the control of the individual---father's and mother's education; father's occupation; race; and region of birth. The paper provides a range of estimates of the importance of these opportunity-forming circumstances in accounting for earnings inequality in one of the world's most unequal countries. We also decompose the effect of opportunities into a direct effect on earnings and an indirect component, which works through the ``effort'' variables. The decomposition is applied to the distribution of male earnings in urban Brazil, in 1996. The five observed circumstances are found to account for between 10 and 37 percent of the Theil index, depending on cohort and allowing for the possibility of biased coefficient estimates due to unobserved correlates. On average, 60 percent of this impact operates through the direct effect on earnings. Parental education is the most important circumstance affecting earnings, but the occupation of the father and race also play a role.},

  abstract = {Natural increase, and net international migration are the demographic processes that determine the amount of growth or decline in a nation's population. In a country such as the United States, the contribution of net international migration to overall population change overshadows the contribution of natural increase. It has long been the practice, however, when making population projections for countries, to consider the role of zero net international migration in an incorrect manner. Some analysts have assumed that if the same number of people leave and enter the country each year, then the effect of net international migration will be zero. This article examines that assumption and shows that it is fallacious. Examining the direct, indirect, total, and negative demographic impacts of zero net international migration through simulations with demographic data, we demonstrate that zero net international migration is not the same and therefore does not have the same demographic results and implications as zero international migration. We conclude that zero net international migration should not be confused with zero international migration. In discussions of international migration in either sending or receiving countries, the two concepts must be kept separate for they are not identical and, moreover, have decidedly different demographic implications and effects.},

  abstract = {Social influence plays an important role in human behavior and decisions. Sources of influence can be divided as external, which are independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the extent of contagion based on large-scale observational data with an unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human dynamics and the detailed approach of social sciences, we present a parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in political science---elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical expression of the county vote-share distribution, which is in excellent agreement with almost a century of observed U.S. presidential election data. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an abrupt phase transition from low to high levels of social contagion, and robust differences among regions. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more instrumental in shaping large-scale collective political behavior, with implications on democratic electoral processes and policies.},

Extensive research has shown that social networks differ by sex and has attempted to explain these differences either through structural availability or individual preferences. Addressing the limitations of these explanations, we build on an increasing body of research emphasizing the role of cognition in the formation and maintenance of networks to argue that males and females may exhibit different strategies for encoding and recalling social information in memory. Further, because activating sex roles can alter cognitive performance, we propose that differences in recall may only or primarily appear when respondents are made aware of their sex. We explore differences in male and female network memory using a laboratory experiment asking respondents to memorize and recall a novel social network after receiving either a sex prime or a control prime. We find that sex significantly impacts social network recall, however being made aware of one's sex does not. Our results provide evidence that differences in male and female networks may be partly due to sex-based differences in network cognition.},

However, in many humanitarian settings, logistical and security concerns make conventional methods for estimating death rates infeasible. We develop and test a new method for estimating death rates in humanitarian emergencies using reports of deaths in survey respondents' social networks. To test our method, we collected original data in Tanganyika Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (N = 5,311), a setting where reliable estimates of crude death rates (CDR) are in high demand. Qualitative fieldwork suggested testing two different types of personal networks as the basis for CDR estimates: deaths among immediate neighbors and deaths among kin. We compare our network-based estimates (0.44 deaths per 10,000 person-days) against a standard retrospective household mortality survey, which estimated a CDR nearly twice as high (0.81 deaths per 10,000 person-days). Given that both methods are equally plausible, our findings underscore the need for further validation and development of both methods.}

In this commentary, we describe five promising new sources of demographic data and their potential appeal. We identify cross-cutting challenges shared by these new data sources and argue that realizing their full potential will demand both innovative methodological developments and continued investment in high-quality, traditional surveys and censuses.

Reliable quantitative estimates of contact patterns are critical to modeling and reducing the spread of directly transmitted infectious diseases. While national-level contact data are available in many countries, including the United States, local-level estimates of age-specific contact patterns are key since disease dynamics and public health policy vary by geography. However, collecting contact data for each state would require a very large sample and be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this challenge, we develop a flexible model to estimate age-specific contact patterns at the subnational level using national-level interpersonal contact data. Our model is based on dynamic multilevel regression with poststratification. We apply this approach to a national sample of interpersonal contact data collected by the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Study (BICS). Results illustrate important state-level variation in levels and trends of contacts across the US.},

  abstract = {Population contact patterns fundamentally determine the spread of directly transmitted airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Reliable quantitative estimates of contact patterns are therefore critical to modeling and reducing the spread of directly transmitted infectious diseases and to assessing the effectiveness of interventions intended to limit risky contacts. While many countries have used surveys and contact diaries to collect national-level contact data, local-level estimates of age-specific contact patterns remain rare. Yet, these local-level data are critical since disease dynamics and public health policy typically vary by geography. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a flexible model that can estimate age-specific contact patterns at the subnational level by combining national-level interpersonal contact data with other locality-specific data sources using multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP). We estimate daily contact matrices for all 50 US states and Washington DC from April 2020 to May 2021 using national contact data from the US. Our results reveal important state-level heterogeneities in levels and trends of contacts across the US over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for the spread of respiratory diseases.},

However, in many humanitarian settings, logistical and security concerns make conventional methods for estimating death rates infeasible. In this study, we develop and test a new method for estimating death rates in humanitarian emergencies. Our method is based on the idea that reports about deaths in survey respondents' social networks can be used to estimate death rates. To test our method, we collected original data in a setting where reliable estimates of death rates are in high demand: Tanganyika Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Qualitative work suggested testing two different types of personal networks as the basis for death rate estimates: deaths among immediate neighbors and deaths among extended kin. We describe a pre-analysis plan for making key comparisons between the crude death rate estimates from the network method and conventional household method. We will evaluate our method by benchmarking against a contemporaneous retrospective household mortality survey.},

Although many SNA-based techniques have been only very recently adopted in primatological research, others have been commonly used by primatologists for decades. The roots of SNA also stem from some of the same conceptual frameworks as the majority of nonhuman primate behavioral research. The rapid development of SNA in recent years has led to questions within the primatological community of where and how SNA fits within this field. We aim to address these questions by providing an overview of the historical relationship between SNA and the study of nonhuman primates. We begin with a brief history of the development of SNA, followed by a detailed description of the network-based visualization techniques, analytical methods and conceptual frameworks which have been employed by primatologists since as early as the 1960s. We also introduce some of the latest advances to SNA, thereby demonstrating that this approach contains novel tools for the study of nonhuman primate social behavior which may be used to shed light on questions that cannot be addressed fully using more conventional methods.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives:~           Partner notification and social network studies of infectious disease often involve interviewing people to elicit their sexual and/or drug injection partners. Incomplete reporting of partners in these contexts would significantly hamper efforts to understand and control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, and other infections. There are many reasons why individuals might not name their partners in interviews. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of forgetting as a cause of incomplete reporting of sexual and injection partners.           Study Design:~           One hundred fifty-six persons in Seattle, Washington, at presumed high risk for HIV recalled their sexual and/or injection partners in two interviews separated by 1 week or 3 months.           Results:~           Repeated, nonspecific prompting elicited, on average, 10\% of all partners recalled in an interview. Subjects displayed substantial forgetting of partners across partner types, recall periods, and four independent measurement approaches, with up to 72\% of partners forgotten. The number of partners recalled and subjective assessment of forgetting are moderate to good predictors of the number of partners forgotten. Recalled and forgotten partners do not differ dramatically on any of several partner variables.           Conclusions:~           Forgetting is a primary factor in the incomplete reporting of sexual and injection partners. Interviewers should prompt repeatedly to maximize recall of partners. Reinterviewing is currently the best method available for identifying partners as completely as possible and should be focused on individuals who report many partners and/or sense they have other partners they cannot recall.},

Several observations on patterns in the recall of persons' names in this community paralleled findings from research on the recall of lexical items.

Prostitution's role in the discrepancy is not readily apparent because men are reluctant to acknowledge that their reported partners include prostitutes.},

Methods:~           Randomized trial of supplementary interviewing techniques during routine partner notification contact interviews for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in Colorado Springs, CO. Cases with multiple sex partners in the last 3 months (n = 123) participated. Interviewers prompted nonspecifically and read back the list of elicited partners after cases recalled partners on their own. We then randomly assigned cases to receive 1 of 3 sets of recall cues: (1) an experimental set of cues consisting of locations where people meet partners, role relationships, network ties, and first letters of names; (2) another experimental set including common first names; and (3) control cues referring to individual characteristics (e.g., physical appearance).           Results:~           Nonspecific prompting and reading back the list each increased the number of additional partners elicited and located by 3\% to 5\% on average. On average, the combined location/role/letter/network cues elicited more additional partners (0.57) than did the first-name (0.29) and individual characteristics (0.28) cues. The location and first-name cues were the most effective in eliciting located partners. The supplementary techniques increased the number of new cases found by 12\% and, importantly, identified branches of the sexual network that would not otherwise have been discovered.           Conclusion:~           Elicitation of sex partners can be enhanced in contact interviews with simple interviewing techniques, resulting in improved network ascertainment and sexually transmitted disease case finding.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the empirical content of one of the most prevalent assumptions in the economics of networks literature, namely the assumption that decision makers have full knowledge about the networks they interact on. Using network data from 75 villages, we ask 4,554 individuals to assess whether five randomly chosen pairs of households in their village are linked through financial, social, and informational relationships. We find that network knowledge is low and highly localized, declining steeply with the pair's network distance to the respondent. 46\% of respondents are not even able to offer a guess about the status of a potential link between a given pair of individuals. Even when willing to offer a guess, respondents can only correctly identify the links 37\% of the time. We also find that a one-step increase in the social distance to the pair corresponds to a 10pp increase in the probability of misidentifying the link. We then investigate the theoretical implications of this assumption by showing that the predictions of various models change substantially if agents behave under the more realistic assumption of incomplete knowledge about the network. Taken together, our results suggest that the assumption of full network knowledge (i) may serve as a poor approximation to the real world and (ii) is not innocuous: allowing for incomplete network knowledge may have first-order implications for a range of qualitative and quantitative results in various contexts.},

  abstract = {The first concern of this work is the development of approximations to the distributions of crude mortality rates, age-specific mortality rates, age-standardized rates, standardized mortality ratios, and the like for the case of a closed population or period study. It is found that assuming Poisson birthtimes and independent lifetimes implies that the number of deaths and the corresponding midyear population have a bivariate Poisson distribution. The Lexis diagram is seen to make direct use of the result. It is suggested that in a variety of cases, it will be satisfactory to approximate the distribution of the number of deaths given the population size, by a Poisson with mean proportional to the population size. It is further suggested that situations in which explanatory variables are present may be modelled via a doubly stochastic Poisson distribution for the number of deaths, with mean proportional to the population size and an exponential function of a linear combination of the explanatories. Such a model is fit to mortality data for Canadian females classified by age and year. A dynamic variant of the model is further fit to the time series of total female deaths alone by year. The models with extra-Poisson variation are found to lead to substantially improved fits.}

An individual's number of partners of the two types defines its degree, and the degrees in the community specify the degree distribution. For this structured network population a simple model for disease transmission is defined and the basic reproduction number R0 is derived, R0 being a size-biased (i.e. biasing individuals with many partners) average number of new infections caused by individuals during the early stages of the epidemic. First a homosexual population is considered and then a heterosexual population. The heterosexual model is fitted to data from a census survey on sexual activity from the Swedish island of Gotland. The main empirical finding is that, for relevant transmission rates, the effect that so-called superspreaders have on R0 is over-estimated when not admitting for different types of partnerships.},

However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.},

  abstract = {In this article, the author reviews current approaches and methods for measuring the scope of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic and their strengths and weaknesses. In recent years, various public health agencies have revised statistical estimates of the scope of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The author considers the reasons underlying these revisions. New sources of data for estimating HIV prevalence have become available, such as nationally representative probability-based surveys. New technologies such as biomarkers that indicate when persons became infected are now used to determine HIV incidence rates. The author summarizes the main sources of errors and problems with these and other approaches and discusses opportunities for improving their reliability. Changing methods and data sources present new challenges, because incidence and prevalence estimates produced at different points in time are not directly comparable with each other, which complicates assessment of time trends. The methodological changes help explain the changes in global statistics. As methods and data sources continue to improve, the development of statistical tools for better assessing the extent to which changes in HIV/AIDS statistics can be attributed to changes in methodology versus real changes in the underlying epidemic is an important challenge.}

In genetically heterogeneous populations, age-specific mortality increases exponentially until about 17 days and then remains constant until the last death occurs at about 60 days. This period of constant age-specific mortality results from genetic heterogeneity. Subpopulations differ in mean life-span, but they all exhibit near exponential, albeit different, rates of increase in age-specific mortality. Thus, much of the observed heterogeneity in mortality rates later in life could result from genetic heterogeneity and not from an inherent effect of aging.}

  abstract = {Background: UNAIDS has developed the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) as a tool for national programmes to use for making national estimates and short term projections of HIV prevalence. EPP provides direct input to Spectrum, which produces incidence, deaths, and AIDS impacts. Methods: The latest version, EPP 2005, includes substantial methodological improvements over the previous version. These include: (1) parallel, but unique, interfaces for generalised and concentrated epidemics; (2) use of maximum likelihood fitting procedures; (3) a new procedure, known as level fits, adjusting for expansion of national surveillance systems into lower prevalence sites; (4) provisions for handling turnover in at-risk populations, including the reassignment of HIV positive former members to lower risk populations; and (5) user-defined calibration to HIV prevalence levels from general population or other epidemiological surveys. Results: Following regional training in mid 2005, this new version has been applied by many national programmes to make their end of 2005 estimates of HIV infections. UNAIDS has combined these national estimates to form the 2005 global HIV and AIDS estimates. Conclusion: EPP 2005 is a substantial improvement over previous versions, forming a solid base for the next round of modifications. Proposed modifications for that next version are presented for the reader's information.},

  abstract = {Romantic courtship is often described as taking place in a dating market where men and women compete for mates, but the detailed structure and dynamics of dating markets have historically been difficult to quantify for lack of suitable data. In recent years, however, the advent and vigorous growth of the online dating industry has provided a rich new source of information on mate pursuit. We present an empirical analysis of heterosexual dating markets in four large U.S. cities using data from a popular, free online dating service. We show that competition for mates creates a pronounced hierarchy of desirability that correlates strongly with user demographics and is remarkably consistent across cities. We find that both men and women pursue partners who are on average about 25\% more desirable than themselves by our measures and that they use different messaging strategies with partners of different desirability. We also find that the probability of receiving a response to an advance drops markedly with increasing difference in desirability between the pursuer and the pursued. Strategic behaviors can improve one's chances of attracting a more desirable mate, although the effects are modest.

  abstract = {Political scientists have long been interested in citizens' support level for such actors as ethnic minorities, militant groups, and authoritarian regimes. Attempts to use direct questioning in surveys, however, have largely yielded unreliable measures of these attitudes as they are contaminated by social desirability bias and high nonresponse rates. In this paper, we develop a statistical methodology to analyze endorsement experiments, which recently have been proposed as a possible solution to this measurement problem. The commonly used statistical methods are problematic because they cannot properly combine responses across multiple policy questions, the design feature of a typical endorsement experiment. We overcome this limitation by using item response theory to estimate support levels on the same scale as the ideal points of respondents. We also show how to extend our model to incorporate a hierarchical structure of data in order to uncover spatial variation of support while recouping the loss of statistical efficiency due to indirect questioning. We illustrate the proposed methodology by applying it to measure political support for Islamist militant groups in Pakistan. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed Bayesian model yields estimates with reasonable levels of bias and statistical power. Finally, we offer several practical suggestions for improving the design and analysis of endorsement experiments.},

If it works with samples the size of typical national surveys, then MRP offers the possibility of analyzing many political phenomena previously believed to be outside the bounds of systematic empirical inquiry. Initial investigations of its performance with conventional national samples produce generally optimistic assessments. This article examines a larger number of cases and a greater range of opinions than in previous studies and finds substantial variation in MRP performance. Through empirical and Monte Carlo analyses, we develop an explanation for this variation. The findings suggest that the conditions necessary for MRP to perform well will not always be met. Thus, we draw a less optimistic conclusion than previous studies do regarding the use of MRP with samples of the size found in typical national surveys.}

Design Population based cohort study with follow-up over 35 years. Setting Municipality of Uppsala, Sweden. Participants 2205 men aged 50 in 1970-3 who were re-examined at ages 60, 70, 77, and 82 years. Main outcome measure Total (all cause) mortality. Results The absolute mortality rate was 27.1, 23.6, and 18.4 per 1000 person years in the groups with low, medium, and high physical activity, respectively. The relative rate reduction attributable to high physical activity was 32\% for low and 22\% for medium physical activity. Men who increased their physical activity level between the ages of 50 and 60 continued to have a higher mortality rate during the first five years of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio 2.64, 95\% confidence interval 1.32 to 5.27, compared with unchanged high physical activity). After 10 years of follow-up their increased physical activity was associated with reduced mortality to the level of men with unchanged high physical activity (1.10, 0.87 to 1.38). The reduction in mortality associated with increased physical activity (0.51, 0.26 to 0.97, compared with unchanged low physical activity) was similar to that associated with smoking cessation (0.64, 0.53 to 0.78, compared with continued smoking). Conclusions Increased physical activity in middle age is eventually followed by a reduction in mortality to the same level as seen among men with constantly high physical activity. This reduction is comparable with that associated with smoking cessation.},

We find that PAPI data contain a large number of errors, which can be avoided in CAPI. Error counts are not randomly distributed across the sample, but are correlated with household characteristics, potentially introducing sample bias if dubious observations need to be dropped. We demonstrate a tendency for the spread of total measured consumption to be higher on paper compared to CAPI, translating into significantly higher measured inequality. Investigating further the nature of PAPI's measurement error for consumption, we fail to reject the hypothesis that it is classical: it attenuates the coefficient on consumption when used as explanatory variable and we find no evidence of bias when consumption is used as dependent variable. Finally, CAPI and PAPI are compared in terms of interview length, costs and respondents' perceptions.},

A two-sample capture-recapture method was carried out. The first capture listed all interviewed IDUs outreached for syringe exchange from April 1 to May 1, 1998; the second capture involved those outreached from May 2 to June 6, 1998. Blood spots were collected for HIV and HCV serologies. Analysis used captured probability model varying with time. We interviewed 55 IDUs in the first capture and 99 in the second; 17 participated in both samples. An estimate of 317 IDUs attending the SEP was obtained (95\% confidence interval [CI] 235-467). Based on the overall seroprevalence rates for HIV (47.7\%) and HCV (53.1\%), it was estimated that 151 IDUs were HIV infected (95\% CI 112-223) and 168 (95\% CI 125-248) were HCV infected. Enumeration of IDUs associated with estimates of the total number of HIV and HCV seropositives provide a powerful tool for SEPs to help monitor the number of IDUs, to plan for provisions, and to organize the new demands on existing health facilities for HIV and HCV care.},

Youngsters who lived at home and worked on the street appeared to be experiencing orderly development despite their impoverished circumstances. Youngsters who lived on the street showed hallmarks of psychological and physical risk, including parental loss, diminished social support, substance abuse, and early onset of sexual activity.

Using a novel data set, we provide evidence of profound social stratification by skin color, even after controlling for specific individual characteristics that previous work has not been able to include, such as individual cognitive and noncognitive abilities, parental education and wealth, and measures of stress and parenting style in the home of origin. Results indicate that people in the lightest skin color category have an average of 1 .4 additional years of schooling and 53 \% more in hourly earnings than their darkest-skinned counterparts. Social mobility is also related to skin color. Individuals in the darkest category are 20 percentile ranks lower in the current wealth distribution than those in the lightest category, conditional on parental wealth. In addition, results of a quantile regression indicate that the darkest group shows higher downward mobility.},

Still, little is known about the relationship between two of the most critical identified factors (frequency of contacts and duration of exposure) and how this relationship applies to different types of infections. By integrating data from two independently collected social surveys (Polymod and time use), we propose a model that combines these two transmission determinants into a new epidemiologically relevant measure of contacts: the number of ``suitable'' contacts, which is the number of contacts that involve a sufficiently long exposure time to allow for transmission. The validity of this new epidemiological measure is tested against Italian serological data for varicella and parvovirus-B19, with uncertainty evaluated using the Bayesian melding technique. The model performs quite well, indicating that the interplay between time of exposure and contacts is critical for varicella transmission, while for B19 it is the duration of exposure that matters for transmission.},

Methods: Clients of sex workers were identified from representative samples of men asked in face-to-face interviews whether they had had sex in exchange for money or whether they had paid for sex, in the last 12 months. A total of 78 national household surveys and nine city based surveys were selected for inclusion. Where such surveys were not available, results of behavioural surveillance surveys and of research studies were also used. Using national estimates, a median percentage of men who reported paying for sex was calculated for each region. Results: The median percentage of men who exchanged sex for money in the last 12 months in all regions was around 9--10\%, with estimates from 13\% to 15\% in Central African region, 10 to 11\% in Eastern and southern Africa, and 5--7\% in Asia and Latin America. Estimates for men who paid sex were much lower at around 2--3\% with ranges from 7\% in the South African region to 1\% in Asia and West Africa. Conclusions: Although errors of measurement and critical issues of definitions and interpretation exist, this compilation represents a first attempt to obtain reasonably coherent estimates of the proportion of men who were clients of sex workers at regional level. Large discrepancies between regions were found. Further improvements in national estimates will be critical to monitor coverage of HIV prevention programmes for sex workers and clients, and to improve estimates of national HIV infection prevalence levels in low and concentrated HIV epidemics.},

  abstract = {When there are two or more data systems and none of them enumerates the population at an acceptable completeness level, concern about the bias due to underenumeration suggests an estimator which makes joint use of data compiled by the combined imperfect data systems. Conventional dual system estimators are based on the existence of two separate data collection systems. Dual system network estimators assume a main survey and a follow-up quality check survey. The main survey adopts a multiplicity counting rule that combines two mutually exclusive partial counting rules. The people that are enumerated in the main survey are eligible for inclusion in the quality check survey if they are enumerable by both partial counting rules. Three dual system network estimators are presented in this paper. One was previously proposed by Sirken (1979) and is the natural analogue of the conventional dual system estimator. The two other estimators are proposed as potential improvements, although neither of them is the natural analogue of the conventional dual system estimator. The design effects of the three estimators are compared analytically and empirically with one another, and with those of the single system conventional and network estimators. /// Quand il y a deux syst{\`e}mes ou plus de collecte de donn{\'e}es, et aucun des syst{\`e}mes {\'e}num{\`e}rent la population {\`a} un niveau acceptable de pr{\'e}cision, des soucis relatif au biais d{\^u} {\`a} la sous-{\'e}num{\'e}ration sugg{\`e}re un estimateur qui emploie conjointement les donn{\'e}es recueillis par les deux syst{\`e}mes imparfaits de donn{\'e}es.

  abstract = {From economist Anne Case and Nobel Prize winner Angus Deaton, a groundbreaking account of how the flaws in capitalism are fatal for America's working classLife expectancy in the United States has recently fallen for three years in a row---a reversal not seen since 1918 or in any other wealthy nation in modern times. In the past two decades, deaths of despair from suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholism have risen dramatically, and now claim hundreds of thousands of American lives each year---and they're still rising. Anne Case and Angus Deaton, known for first sounding the alarm about deaths of despair, explain the overwhelming surge in these deaths and shed light on the social and economic forces that are making life harder for the working class. They demonstrate why, for those who used to prosper in America, capitalism is no longer delivering.Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism paints a troubling portrait of the American dream in decline. For the white working class, today's America has become a land of broken families and few prospects. As the college educated become healthier and wealthier, adults without a degree are literally dying from pain and despair. In this critically important book, Case and Deaton tie the crisis to the weakening position of labor, the growing power of corporations, and, above all, to a rapacious health-care sector that redistributes working-class wages into the pockets of the wealthy. Capitalism, which over two centuries lifted countless people out of poverty, is now destroying the lives of blue-collar America.This book charts a way forward, providing solutions that can rein in capitalism's excesses and make it work for everyone.},

  abstract = {We build on and extend the findings in  on increases in mortality and morbidity among white non-Hispanic Americans in midlife since the turn of the century. Increases in all-cause mortality continued unabated to 2015, with additional increases in drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality, particularly among those with a high-school degree or less. The decline in mortality from heart disease has slowed and, most recently, stopped, and this combined with the three other causes is responsible for the increase in all-cause mortality. Not only are educational differences in mortality among whites increasing, but from 1998 to 2015 mortality rose for those without, and fell for those with, a college degree. This is true for non-Hispanic white men and women in all five year age groups from 35--39 through 55--59. Mortality rates among blacks and Hispanics continued to fall; in 1999, the mortality rate of white non-Hispanics aged 50--54 with only a high-school degree was 30 percent lower than the mortality rate of blacks in the same age group but irrespective of education; by 2015, it was 30 percent higher. There are similar crossovers in all age groups from 25--29 to 60--64., Mortality rates in comparable rich countries have continued their pre-millennial fall at the rates that used to characterize the US. In contrast to the US, mortality rates in Europe are falling for those with low levels of educational attainment, and have fallen further over this period than mortality rates for those with higher levels of education., Many commentators have suggested that poor mortality outcomes can be attributed to contemporaneous levels of resources, particularly to slowly growing, stagnant, and even declining incomes; we evaluate this possibility, but find that it cannot provide a comprehensive explanation. In particular, the income profiles for blacks and Hispanics, whose mortality rates have fallen, are no better than those for whites. Nor is there any evidence in the European data that mortality trends match income trends, in spite of sharply different patterns of median income across countries after the Great Recession., We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next, in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health, is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education. This account, which fits much of the data, has the profoundly negative implication that policies, even ones that successfully improve earnings and jobs, or redistribute income, will take many years to reverse the mortality and morbidity increase, and that those in midlife now are likely to do much worse in old age than those currently older than 65. This is in contrast to an account in which resources affect health contemporaneously, so that those in midlife now can expect to do better in old age as they receive Social Security and Medicare. None of this implies that there are no policy levers to be pulled; preventing the over-prescription of opioids is an obvious target that would clearly be helpful.},

  abstract = {Significance             Midlife increases in suicides and drug poisonings have been previously noted. However, that these upward trends were persistent and large enough to drive up all-cause midlife mortality has, to our knowledge, been overlooked. If the white mortality rate for ages 45-54 had held at their 1998 value, 96,000 deaths would have been avoided from 1999--2013, 7,000 in 2013 alone. If it had continued to decline at its previous (1979-1998) rate, half a million deaths would have been avoided in the period 1999-2013, comparable to lives lost in the US AIDS epidemic through mid-2015. Concurrent declines in self-reported health, mental health, and ability to work, increased reports of pain, and deteriorating measures of liver function all point to increasing midlife distress.           ,              This paper documents a marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013. This change reversed decades of progress in mortality and was unique to the United States; no other rich country saw a similar turnaround. The midlife mortality reversal was confined to white non-Hispanics; black non-Hispanics and Hispanics at midlife, and those aged 65 and above in every racial and ethnic group, continued to see mortality rates fall. This increase for whites was largely accounted for by increasing death rates from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Although all education groups saw increases in mortality from suicide and poisonings, and an overall increase in external cause mortality, those with less education saw the most marked increases. Rising midlife mortality rates of white non-Hispanics were paralleled by increases in midlife morbidity. Self-reported declines in health, mental health, and ability to conduct activities of daily living, and increases in chronic pain and inability to work, as well as clinically measured deteriorations in liver function, all point to growing distress in this population. We comment on potential economic causes and consequences of this deterioration.},

We believe it is a critical demographic factor in the development of human culture. Here, we examine when changes in longevity occurred by assessing the ratio of older to younger adults in four hominid dental samples from successive time periods, and by determining the significance of differences in these ratios. Younger and older adult status is assessed by wear seriation of each sample. Whereas there is significant increased longevity between all groups, indicating a trend of increased adult survivorship over the course of human evolution, there is a dramatic increase in longevity in the modern humans of the Early Upper Paleolithic. We believe that this great increase contributed to population expansions and cultural innovations associated with modernity.},

In many cases this leads to migration policies with contradictory objectives or hidden agendas.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}This paper explores the dynamics between poverty and exclusion; neighbourhood, and health and well being by considering the role of social networks and social capital in the social processes involved. It is based on qualitative research taking two deprived areas as exemplary case studies, and involving depth interviews with residents. Neighbourhood influences on networks and social capital were explored, network typologies developed reflecting structural and cultural aspects of individual's networks, and pathways implicated in health effects considered. The complexity of social capital is addressed. The role of three factors in influencing social networks and social capital are demonstrated: neighbourhood characteristics and perceptions; poverty and social exclusion, and social consciousness. Perceptions of inequality could be a source of social capital as well as demoralisation. Different network structures- dense and weak, homogeneous and heterogeneous- were involved in the creation of social capital and had implications for well being. Coping, enjoyment of life and hope are identified as benefits. Although participation in organisations was confirmed as beneficial, it is suggested that today's heterogeneous neighbourhoods also require regenerated local work opportunities to develop bridging ties necessary for the genesis of inclusive social capital and better health. Despite the capacity of social capital to buffer its harsher effects, the concept is not wholly adequate for explaining the deleterious effects of poverty on health and well being.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, from data collected during a H1N1 pandemic (pdm) influenza outbreak that started in an elementary school and spread in a semirural community in Pennsylvania, we quantify how transmission of influenza is affected by social networks. We set up a transmission model for which parameters are estimated from the data via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Sitting next to a case or being the playmate of a case did not significantly increase the risk of infection; but the structuring of the school into classes and grades strongly affected spread. There was evidence that boys were more likely to transmit influenza to other boys than to girls (and vice versa), which mimicked the observed assortative mixing among playmates. We also investigated the presence of abnormally high transmission occurring on specific days of the outbreak. Late closure of the school (i.e., when 27\% of students already had symptoms) had no significant impact on spread. School-aged individuals (6--18 y) facilitated the introduction and spread of influenza in households, but only about one in five cases aged {$>$}18 y was infected by a school-aged household member. This analysis shows the extent to which clearly defined social networks affect influenza transmission, revealing strong between-place interactions with back-and-forth waves of transmission between the school, the community, and the household.},

Examples include the spread of high-risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length. Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of many spatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed tendency for social movements to diffuse spatially.}

Can the lessons learned from the viral diffusion of diseases be used to improve the spread of beneficial behaviors and innovations? In How Behavior Spreads, Damon Centola presents over a decade of original research examining how changes in societal behavior--in voting, health, technology, and finance---occur and the ways social networks can be used to influence how they propagate. Centola's startling findings show that the same conditions accelerating the viral expansion of an epidemic unexpectedly inhibit the spread of behaviors.While it is commonly believed that "weak ties"---long-distance connections linking acquaintances---lead to the quicker spread of behaviors, in fact the exact opposite holds true. Centola demonstrates how the most well-known, intuitive ideas about social networks have caused past diffusion efforts to fail, and how such efforts might succeed in the future. Pioneering the use of Web-based methods to understand how changes in people's social networks alter their behaviors, Centola illustrates the ways in which these insights can be applied to solve countless problems of organizational change, cultural evolution, and social innovation. His findings offer important lessons for public health workers, entrepreneurs, and activists looking to harness networks for social change.Practical and informative, How Behavior Spreads is a must-read for anyone interested in how the theory of social networks can transform our world.},

  abstract = {Finding an efficient method for sampling micro- and small-enterprises (MSEs) for research and statistical reporting purposes is a challenge in developing countries, where registries of MSEs are often nonexistent or outdated. This lack of a sampling frame creates an obstacle in finding a representative sample of MSEs. This study uses computer simulations to draw samples from a census of businesses and non-businesses in the Tshwane Municipality of South Africa, using three different sampling methods: the traditional probability sampling method, the compact segment sampling method, and the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) sampling method. Three mechanisms by which the methods could differ are tested, the proximity selection of respondents, the at-home selection of respondents, and the use of inaccurate probability weights. The results highlight the importance of revisits and accurate probability weights, and the lesser effect of proximity selection on the samples' statistical properties.},

Models where age-specific mutations have pleiotropic effects on mortality that extend either throughout adult life, or are confined to juvenile stages, produce equilibria with exponential increases in the mean and additive variance of mortality rates during much of adult life. However, the rates of increase diminish late in life, and can even become zero. Predictions concerning the additive genetic correlations in mortality rates between different ages are also developed.

  abstract = {Reducing excess population mortality caused by crises due to armed conflict and natural disasters is an existential aim of humanitarian assistance, but the extent to which these deaths are averted in different humanitarian responses is mostly unknown. This information gap arguably weakens governance and accountability. This paper considers methodological challenges involved in making inferences about humanitarian assistance's effect on excess mortality, and outlines proposed approaches. Three possible measurement questions, each of which contributes some inferential evidence, are presented: (1) whether mortality has remained within an acceptable range during the crisis (for which different direct estimation options are presented); (2) whether the humanitarian response is sufficiently appropriate and performant to avert excess mortality (a type of contribution analysis requiring in-depth audits of the design of humanitarian services and of their actual availability, coverage and quality); and (3) the actual extent to which humanitarian assistance has reduced excess deaths (potentially the most complex question to answer, requiring application of causal thinking and careful specification of the exposure, and for which either quasi-experimental statistical modelling approaches or a combination of verbal and social autopsy methods are proposed). The paper concludes by considering possible `packages' of the above methods that could be implemented at different stages of a humanitarian response, and calls for investment in improved methods and actual measurement.},

Insecurity escalated in 2013 to 2015, but the humanitarian response was delayed and the crisis' health impact was unquantified due to incomplete death registration and limited ground access. We estimated mortality attributable to this crisis using a small-area estimation approach that circumvented these challenges. We fitted a mixed effects model to household mortality data collected as part of 70 ground surveys implemented by humanitarian actors. Model predictors, drawn from existing data, included livelihood typology, staple cereal price, vaccination geocoverage, and humanitarian actor presence. To project accurate death tolls, we reconstructed population denominators based on forced displacement. We used the model and population estimates to project mortality under observed conditions and varying assumed counterfactual conditions, had there been no crisis, with the difference providing excess mortality. Death rates were highly elevated across most ground surveys, with net negative household migration. Between April 2016 and December 2019, we projected 490,000 excess deaths (230,000 children under 5 y) in the most likely counterfactual scenario, with a range from 90,000 (best-case) to 550,000 (worst-case). Death rates were two to three times higher than counterfactual levels, double the projected national rate, and highest in 2016 to 2017. Despite limited scope (we could not study the situation before 2016 or in neighboring affected countries), our findings suggest a staggering health impact of this crisis. Further studies to document mortality in this and other crises are needed to guide decision-making and memorialize their human toll.},

Using our new dataset, we devise a framework for resynthesizing portrait images across time, imagining how a portrait taken during a particular decade might have looked like had it been taken in other decades. Our framework optimizes a family of per-decade generators that reveal subtle changes that differentiate decades---such as different hairstyles or makeup---while maintaining the identity of the input portrait. Experiments show that our method can more effectively resynthesizing portraits across time compared to state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, as well as attribute-based and language-guided portrait editing models.

  abstract = {Social capital---the strength of an individual's social network and community---has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health1--8. However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers9, we use data on 21\,billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by ZIP (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status (SES); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-SES friends among individuals with low SES---which we term economic connectedness---is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date10,11. Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-SES parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-SES parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20\% on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality12--14. To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by ZIP code at https://www.socialcapital.org.},

Here we analyse the determinants of cross-class interaction using data from Facebook, building on the analysis in our companion paper7. We show that about half of the social disconnection across socioeconomic lines---measured as the difference in the share of high-socioeconomic status (SES)~friends between people with low and high SES---is explained by differences in exposure to people with high SES in groups such as schools and religious organizations. The other half is explained by friending bias---the tendency for people with low SES to befriend people with high SES at lower rates even conditional on exposure. Friending bias is shaped by the structure of the groups in which people interact. For example, friending bias is higher in larger and more diverse groups and lower in religious organizations than in schools and workplaces. Distinguishing exposure from friending bias is helpful for identifying interventions to increase cross-SES friendships (economic connectedness). Using fluctuations in the share of students with high SES across high school cohorts, we show that increases in high-SES~exposure lead~low-SES people to form more friendships with high-SES people~in schools that exhibit low levels of friending bias. Thus, socioeconomic integration can increase economic connectedness in communities in which friending bias is low. By contrast, when friending bias is high, increasing cross-SES interactions among existing members may be necessary to increase economic connectedness. To support such efforts, we release privacy-protected statistics on economic connectedness, exposure and friending bias for each ZIP~(postal) code, high school and college in the United States at https://www.socialcapital.org.},

  abstract = {Background: PMA2020 is a survey platform with resident enumerators using mobile phones. Instead of collecting full birth history, total fertility rates (TFR) have been measured with a limited number of questions on recent births. Employing new approaches provides opportunities to test and advance survey methods. Objective: This study aims to assess the quality of fertility data in PMA2020 surveys, focusing on bias introduced from the questionnaire and completeness and distribution of birth month and year, and to estimate TFR adjusted for identified data quality issues. Methods: To assess underestimation from the questionnaire, we simulated births that would be counted using the PMA2020 questionnaires compared to births identified from full birth history. We analyzed the latest Demographic and Health Surveys in ten countries where PMA2020 surveys have been implemented. We assessed the level of reporting completeness for birth month and year and heaping of birth month, analyzing 39 PMA2020 surveys. Finally, TFR were calculated and adjusted for biases introduced from the questionnaire and heaping in birth month. Results: Simple questions introduced minor bias from undercounting multiple births, which was expected and correctable. Meanwhile, incomplete reporting of birth month was relatively high, and the default value of January in data collection software systematically moved births with missing months out of the reference period. On average across the 39 surveys, TFR increased by 1.6\% and 2.4\%, adjusted for undercounted multiple births and heaping on January, respectively. Contribution: This study emphasizes the importance of enumerator training and provides critical insight in software programming in surveys using mobile technologies.}

  abstract = {This dissertation collects four essays on transformative developments in contemporary European politics. These include the polarization of European party systems, exemplified by the rise of outsider parties at the fringes of the political spectrum; the loosening of traditional partisan bonds; the erosion of the political center; and social polarization, driven by the politicization of Europeanization, immigration, and national identity.  								  The first essay, Bad Times or Bad Types?, examines the rise of the populist right in Europe through the prism of local politics in France.  Examining a natural experiment involving wrongheaded financial decisions by local governments, it shows that populist voting can be a mechanism of elite accountability -- albeit one that is imperfect and conditioned by access to information.  								  The second essay, The Distortionary Effects of Turnout Inequality, examines the implications of the political dealignment of working-class voters for electoral outcomes and party strategy in contemporary German politics.  It questions the longstanding belief that turnout inequality -- the lower propensity for younger, less-educated, and lower-income respondents to vote -- systematically disadvantages Left parties.  Drawing on an original survey and experiment, it shows that nonvoters in Germany are indeed poorer and less-educated than the electorate, but that they are also significantly more xenophobic than supporters of Left parties.  								  Taking a broader view, the third essay, Party Strategy After Social Democracy, counterposes two explanations for the decline of Left parties in Western Europe.  These include (1) steadily diverging preferences between the Left's two traditional constituencies, middle- and working-class voters; and (2) the strategic decision of many Left parties to moderate in order to pursue more middle-class voters.  It amasses historical and contemporary survey evidence to show that the decline of Left parties is structural rather than strategic in nature.  								  The dissertation closes with a fourth essay, Lying on Surveys.  This essay is unique in that it is mainly a contribution to political methodology, albeit with an application to survey data from Europe.  In this chapter, I develop new statistical tools for measuring misreporting on surveys and apply them to a survey experiment conducted among radical right voters in Germany.},

The major drawback of these approaches, however, is their inefficiency relative to direct questioning. We show how to improve the statistical analysis of the list experiment, randomized response technique, and endorsement experiment by exploiting auxiliary information on the sensitive trait. We apply the proposed methodology to survey experiments conducted among voters in a controversial antiabortion referendum held during the 2011 Mississippi General Election. By incorporating the official county-level election results, we obtain precinct- and individual-level estimates that are more accurate than standard indirect questioning estimates and occasionally even more efficient than direct questioning. Our simulation studies shed light on the conditions under which our approach can improve the efficiency and robustness of estimates based on indirect questioning techniques. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},

The application of this culture--gene coevolutionary approach to understanding human social psychology has generated novel insights into the cognitive and affective foundations of large-scale cooperation, social norms and ethnicity. This approach hypothesizes a norm-psychology: a suite of psychological adaptations for inferring, encoding in memory, adhering to, enforcing and redressing violations of the shared behavioral standards of one's community. After reviewing the substantial body of formal theory underpinning these predictions, we outline how this account organizes diverse empirical findings in the cognitive sciences and related disciplines. Norm-psychology offers explanatory traction on the evolved psychological mechanisms that underlie cultural evolution, cross-cultural differences and the emergence of norms.}

  abstract = {The majority of countries in Africa and nearly one-third of all countries require mortality models to infer the complete age schedules of mortality that are required to conduct population estimates, projections/forecasts, and other tasks in demography and epidemiology. Models that relate child mortality to mortality at other ages are important because almost all countries have measures of child mortality. A general, parameterizable component model (SVD-Comp) of mortality is defined using the singular value decomposition and calibrated to the relationship between child or child/adult mortality and mortality at other ages in the observed mortality schedules of the Human Mortality Database. Cross-validation is used to validate the model, and the predictive performance of the model is compared with that of the log-quadratic (Log-Quad) model, which is designed to do the same thing. Prediction and cross-validation tests indicate that the child mortality--calibrated SVD-Comp is able to accurately represent the observed mortality schedules in the Human Mortality Database, is robust to the selection of mortality schedules used for calibration, and performs better than the Log-Quad model. The child mortality--calibrated SVD-Comp can be used where and when child mortality is available but mortality at other ages is unknown.}

However, when asked about sensitive topics such as their sexual behavior or illegal activity, some respondents lie or refuse to answer. The randomized response method was developed to reduce these evasive answer biases by guaranteeing subject privacy. However, the method has been criticized as being susceptible to cheaters, that is, respondents who do not answer as directed by the randomizing device. Here the authors show that by splitting the sample into 2 groups and assigning each group a different randomization probability, it is possible to detect whether significant cheating is occurring and to estimate its extent while simultaneously protecting the identity of cheaters and those who may have engaged in sensitive behaviors.

The TSS sample included the largest proportion of TW (30.7 \%) and the lowest percentage of subjects who had previously participated in HIV/STI research (14.9 \%). The prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV infection, according to participants' self-reported previous HIV diagnosis, was highest among TSS recruits (17.9 \%) compared with RDS (12.6 \%) and CS (10.2 \%).

  abstract = {Objective.---To examine the hypothesis that diverse ties to friends, family, work, and community are associated with increased host resistance to infection.Design.---After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg, spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a common cold.Setting.---Quarantine.Participants.---A total of 276 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor pregnant.Outcome Measures.---Colds (illness in the presence of a verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount of viral replication.Results.---In response to both viruses, those with more types of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus. These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index, education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more) types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence, low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being introverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and incidence of colds.Conclusions.---More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.}

  abstract = {This paper considers international migration in the context of population ageing. In many Western countries, the search for appropriate responses to manage future population ageing and population decline has directed attention to international migration. It seems reasonable to believe that international migrants, mostly of young working age, can supply population deficits created by low birth rates, protect European society and economy from the economic costs of elderly dependency, and provide a workforce to care for the elderly. Particular prominence has been given to this option through the publicity attendant on a report from the UN Population Division in 2000 on 'replacement migration', which has been widely reported and widely misunderstood. Although immigration can prevent population decline, it is already well known that it can only prevent population ageing at unprecedented, unsustainable and increasing levels of inflow, which would generate rapid population growth and eventually displace the original population from its majority position. This paper reviews these arguments in the context of the causes and inevitability of population ageing, with examples mostly based on UK data. It discusses various options available in response to population ageing through workforce, productivity, pensions reform and other means. It concludes that there can be no 'solution' to population ageing, which is to a considerable degree unavoidable. However, if the demographic regime of the United Kingdom continues to be relatively benign, future population ageing can be managed with tolerable inconvenience without recourse to increased immigration for 'demographic' purposes. At present (2001), net immigration to the United Kingdom is already running at record levels and is now the main engine behind UK population and household growth. By itself, population stabilization, or even mild reduction, is probably to be welcomed in the United Kingdom, although the issue has attracted little attention since the 1970s.}

Hair specimens were screened using a radio immunoassay. Screened-positive specimens were confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Results Using hair-test results as the standard, specificity of self-reports was 98\% or higher for both drugs. The sensitivity of all self-reports was low, although lifetime use reports had somewhat higher sensitivities. The sensitivity of self-reports of recent cocaine use was particularly low, 7.1\%. The sensitivity of heroin use reports was somewhat higher, 33.3\% for recent use and 66.7\% for lifetime use. The estimate of recent cocaine use based on hair tests was 13.7 times the estimate generated from interview reports. For heroin use, the test-based estimate was 2.9 times the rate generated from the interview reports. A shift from the cut-off level of 0.2 ng/mg to 0.5 ng/mg had only a marginal improvement on validity, with sensitivity increasing from 7.1\% to 11.1\% for self-reported recent cocaine use.Conclusions The results suggest that drug users, for the most part, are not willing to disclose their use of drugs in household surveys in Puerto Rico. Methods to increase the willingness of respondents to disclose their use of drugs are needed.}

We created a mobile chat platform to study the impact of such discussions. Our study recruited Republicans and Democrats in the United States to complete a survey about their political views. We later randomized them into treatment conditions where they were offered financial incentives to use our platform to discuss a contentious policy issue with an opposing partisan. We found that people who engage in anonymous cross-party conversations about political topics exhibit substantial decreases in polarization compared with a placebo group that wrote an essay using the same conversation prompts. Moreover, these depolarizing effects were correlated with the civility of dialogue between study participants. Our findings demonstrate the potential for well-designed social media platforms to mitigate political polarization and underscore the need for a flexible platform for scientific research on social media.},

Of these, 32.5\% report supporting Trump's candidacy. A list experiment conducted on the same respondents yields an estimate 29.6\%, suggesting that Trump's poll numbers were not artificially deflated by social desirability bias as the list experiment estimate is actually lower than direct question estimate. I further investigate differences across measurement modes for relevant demographic and political subgroups and find no evidence in support of the ``Shy Trump Supporter'' hypothesis.},

The DHS collect a wide range of objective and self-reported data with a strong focus on indicators of fertility, reproductive health, maternal and child health, mortality, nutrition and self-reported health behaviours among adults. Key advantages of the DHS include high response rates, national coverage, high quality interviewer training, standardized data collection procedures across countries and consistent content over time, allowing comparability across populations cross-sectionally and over time. Data from DHS facilitate epidemiological research focused on monitoring of prevalence, trends and inequalities. A variety of robust observational data analysis methods have been used, including cross-sectional designs, repeated cross-sectional designs, spatial and multilevel analyses, intra-household designs and cross-comparative analyses. In this profile, we present an overview of the DHS along with an introduction to the potential scope for these data in contributing to the field of micro- and macro-epidemiology.

The United States does have higher rates of infant mortality and violent deaths than in other developed countries, but these factors do not fully account for the country's relatively poor ranking in life expectancy.  International Differences in Mortality at Older Ages: Dimensions and Sources examines patterns in international differences in life expectancy above age 50 and assesses the evidence and arguments that have been advanced to explain the poor position of the United States relative to other countries. The papers in this deeply researched volume identify gaps in measurement, data, theory, and research design and pinpoint areas for future high-priority research in this area.  In addition to examining the differences in mortality around the world, the papers in International Differences in Mortality at Older Ages look at health factors and life-style choices commonly believed to contribute to the observed international differences in life expectancy. They also identify strategic opportunities for health-related interventions. This book offers a wide variety of disciplinary and scholarly perspectives to the study of mortality, and it offers in-depth analyses that can serve health professionals, policy makers, statisticians, and researchers.},

Various techniques have been developed to guarantee anonymity and minimize the respondent's feelings of jeopardy. Two such techniques are the randomized response technique (RRT) and the unmatched count technique (UCT). In this study the authors evaluate the effectiveness of different implementations of the RRT (using a forced-response design) in a computer-assisted setting and also compare the use of the RRT to that of the UCT. The techniques are evaluated according to various quality criteria, such as the prevalence estimates they provide, the ease of their use, and respondent trust in the techniques. The results indicate that the RRTs are problematic with respect to several domains, such as the limited trust they inspire and nonresponse, and that the RRT estimates are unreliable due to a strong false no bias, especially for the more sensitive questions. The UCT, however, performed well compared to the RRTs on all the evaluated measures. The authors conclude that the UCT is a promising alternative to RRT in self-administered surveys and that future research should be directed toward evaluating and improving the technique.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The UN Replacement Migration report (2000) had a significant impact in academic and civil society. Its approach consisted of estimating the migration volumes required to mitigate the effects of population decline and ageing. The volume of migrants required to prevent population decline and sustain the working-age population was not particularly high, but the vast number of migrants needed to maintain the potential support ratio was highlighted as an unrealistic goal. OBJECTIVES In this paper the UN exercise is revisited and updated by deploying the concept of prospective age to overcome a strict chronological definition of the working-age population. The replacement migration approach is developed from a new European perspective, the temporal series is extended for an additional decade, and alternative operative age-group definitions are compared by projecting replacement migration estimations according to both classic (conventional) and dynamic (prospective) age limits. CONCLUSIONS The key conclusions of the original UN publication are reasserted. In many countries the replacement migration volumes needed to sustain the decline in total population and working-age population are of an order of magnitude similar to recent observed migration. However, even under the prospective-age approach the halt of the ageing process -- expressed as the maintenance of the current potential support ratio -- remains an unrealistic target. CONTRIBUTION We propose the deployment of the prospective-age concept to define dynamic age limits in the definition of working-age population. Because the prospective-age concept is flexible it will be possible to explore other dimensions from this perspective in the future, increasing the analytical potential of replacement migration estimations as a valuable contribution to the demographic ageing debate.}

  abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a chain-referral method for sampling members of hidden or hard-to-reach populations, such as sex workers, homeless people, or drug users, via their social networks. Most methodological work on RDS has focused on inference of population means under the assumption that subjects' network degree determines their probability of being sampled. Criticism of existing estimators is usually focused on missing data: the underlying network is only partially observed, so it is difficult to determine correct sampling probabilities. In this article, the author shows that data collected in ordinary RDS studies contain information about the structure of the respondents' social network. The author constructs a continuous-time model of RDS recruitment that incorporates the time series of recruitment events, the pattern of coupon use, and the network degrees of sampled subjects. Together, the observed data and the recruitment model place a well-defined probability distribution on the recruitment-induced subgraph of respondents. The author shows that this distribution can be interpreted as an exponential random graph model and develops a computationally efficient method for estimating the hidden graph. The author validates the method using simulated data and applies the technique to an RDS study of injection drug users in St. Petersburg, Russia.},

  abstract = {Estimating the size of stigmatized, hidden, or hard-to-reach populations is a major problem in epidemiology, demography, and public health research. Capture-recapture and multiplier methods have become standard tools for inference of hidden population sizes, but they require independent random sampling of target population members, which is rarely possible. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a survey method for hidden populations that relies on social link tracing. The RDS recruitment process is designed to spread through the social network connecting members of the target population. In this paper, we show how to use network data revealed by RDS to estimate hidden population size. The key insight is that the recruitment chain, timing of recruitments, and network degrees of recruited subjects provide information about the number of individuals belonging to the target population who are not yet in the sample. We use a computationally efficient Bayesian method to integrate over the missing edges in the subgraph of recruited individuals. We validate the method using simulated data and apply the technique to estimate the number of people who inject drugs in St. Petersburg, Russia.},

Analysis of large cohorts of ten genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster raised under conditions that favored extended survival has revealed variation between genotypes in both the slope and location of age-specific mortality curves. More detailed examination of a single genotype showed that the mortality trajectory was best fit by a two-stage Gompertz model, with no age-specific increase in mortality rates beyond 30 days after emergence. These results are contrary to the limited life-span paradigm, which postulates well-defined, genotype-specific limits on life-span and brief periods of intense and rapidly accelerating mortality rates at the oldest age.}

The measurement errors associated with obtaining reports on cancer diagnosis and the date of diagnosis are presented.

Females and Whites were more likely to be reported than males and non-Whites. A significant amount of variation and error in reporting date of diagnosis was found for both the patient and the relative households.

We review the evidence for such effects of epigenetic, ecological and cultural inheritance and parental effects, and outline methods that quantify the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic heritability to the transmission of phenotypic variation across generations.

The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights.

In this article we develop an approach that allows for varying susceptibility to capture through individual parameters using a variant of the Rasch model from psychological measurement situations. Our approach requires an additional recapture. In the context of census undercount estimation, this requirement amounts to the use of a second independent sample or alternative data source to be matched with census and Post-Enumeration Survey (PES) data. The models we develop provide a mechanism for separating out the dependence between census and PES induced by individual heterogeneity. The resulting data take the form of an incomplete 23 contingency table, and we describe how to estimate the expected values of the observable cells of this table using log-linear quasi-symmetry models.

Social sampling leads to a novel trade-off question: the savings in the number of samples(roughly the average degree of the network of participants) vs. the systematic bias in the poll due to the network structure. We provide precise analyses of estimators that result from this idea. With non-uniform sampling of nodes and non-uniform weighting of neighbors' responses, we devise an ideal unbiased estimator. We show that the variance of this estimator is controlled by the second eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian of the network (the network structure penalty) and the correlation between node degrees and the property being measured (the effective savings factor). In addition, we present a sequence of approximate estimators that are simpler or more realistic or both, and analyze their performance. Experiments on large real-world networks show that social sampling is a powerful paradigm in obtaining accurate estimates with very few samples. At the same time, our results urge caution in interpreting recent results about "expectation vs. intent polling".},

  abstract = {The Gompertz mortality function, Rm = R0e{$\alpha$}t, is frequently used to describe changes in mortality rate (Rm) with time (t). In this paper, four methods for determining the best fit values of the two parameters, R0 and {$\alpha$}, are compared. Three of the four methods use the Gompertz mortality function with mortality rate estimates derived from survival data to determine the best fit values of the two parameters. All three confront problems. The fourth method uses the Gompertz survival function, which can be derived from the Gompertz mortality function and which allows one to use survival data directly. It thereby avoids the problems and generally gives the best estimates for the two parameters. The use of the mortality function, with mortality rate estimates, confronts four distinct problems. One of these is caused by time intervals when zero organisms die. A second is caused by errors produced in estimating mortality rates from survival data. If too high a proportion of a population die in a given time interval, the mortality rate estimates are too low. A third problem is the sensitivity of the mortality-equation-based analyses to values at the end of the survival curve, where scatter in mortality values tends to be greater. A final problem occurs when time intervals greater than one time unit (day, week, year, etc.) are used in the analysis. Such problems with the use of mortality rates to estimate parameter values are revealed when the calculated parameters are used to produce a survival curve, or when known values of R0 and {$\alpha$} are used to generate survival data. This paper introduces a non-linear regression analysis, using a Simplex algorithm to fit parameters R0 and {$\alpha$} in the Gompertz Survival function and concludes that it gives more reliable and consistent results with a variety of data than do three methods that use the mortality function.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children1--4. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21\% (95\% credible interval: 12--31\%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69\% (57--82\%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures---such as many low-income countries---the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.},

Social network structure and the degree of homophily in a network affect how health behaviors and innovations are spread. However, the degree of health behavior homophily across different social ties and within subpopulations is unknown. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by using a novel regression model to document the degree of homophily across various relationship types and subpopulations for behaviors of interest that are related to health outcomes. These patterns in health behavior homophily have implications for which behaviors and ties should be the subjects of future research and for predicting how homophily may shape health programs focused on specific subpopulations (gender, race, class, health status) or a specific social context (families, peer groups, classrooms, or school activities).},

Although we do not completely reject that notion, we quantify some of the effects that poor quality data have on final study results in terms of estimation, significance testing, and power. By introducing digit errors into simulated blood pressure measurements we demonstrate that simple range checks allow us to detect (and therefore correct) the main errors that impact the final study results and conclusions. The errors that cannot easily be detected by such range checks, although possibly numerous, are shown to be of little importance in drawing the correct conclusions from the statistical analysis of data. Exploratory data analysis cannot identify all errors that a second data entry would detect, but on the other hand, not all errors that are found by exploratory data analysis are detectable by double data entry. Double data entry is concerned solely with ensuring, to a high degree of certainty, that what is recorded on the case record form is transcribed into the database. Exploratory data analysis looks beyond the case record form to challenge the plausibility of the written data. In this sense, the second entering of data has some benefit, but the use of exploratory data analysis methods, either as data entry is ongoing or at the end of data entry and as the first stage in an analysis strategy, should always be mandatory.},

However, methods for obtaining probabilistic samples of drivers who drink at these places remain a challenge -- since there is no a priori information on this mobile population -- and must be continually improved. This paper describes the procedures adopted in the selection of a population-based sample of drivers who drank at alcohol selling outlets in Porto Alegre, Brazil, which we used to estimate the prevalence of intention to drive under the influence of alcohol. The sampling strategy comprises a stratified three-stage cluster sampling: 1) census enumeration areas (CEA) were stratified by alcohol outlets (AO) density and sampled with probability proportional to the number of AOs in each CEA; 2) combinations of outlets and shifts (COS) were stratified by prevalence of alcohol-related traffic crashes and sampled with probability proportional to their squared duration in hours; and, 3) drivers who drank at the selected COS were stratified by their intention to drive and sampled using inverse sampling. Sample weights were calibrated using a post-stratification estimator. 3,118 individuals were approached and 683 drivers interviewed, leading to an estimate that 56.3\% (SE{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3,5\%) of the drivers intended to drive after drinking in less than one hour after the interview. Prevalence was also estimated by sex and broad age groups. The combined use of stratification and inverse sampling enabled a good trade-off between resource and time allocation, while preserving the ability to generalize the findings. The current strategy can be viewed as a step forward in the efforts to improve surveys and estimation for hard-to-reach, mobile populations.}

Often overlooked, however, is the impact of tie definition on the corresponding network, and in turn the relevance of the inferred network to the research question of interest. Here we study the problem of network inference and relevance for two email data sets of different size and origin. In each case, we generate a family of networks parameterized by a threshold condition on the frequency of emails exchanged between pairs of individuals. After demonstrating that different choices of the threshold correspond to dramatically different network structures, we then formulate the relevance of these networks in terms of a series of prediction tasks that depend on various network features. In general, we find: a) that prediction accuracy is maximized over a non-trivial range of thresholds corresponding to 5-10 reciprocated emails per year; b) that for any prediction task, choosing the optimal value of the threshold yields a sizable ({\textasciitilde}30\%) boost in accuracy over naive choices; and c) that the optimal threshold value appears to be (somewhat surprisingly) consistent across data sets and prediction tasks. We emphasize the practical utility in defining ties via their relevance to the prediction task(s) at hand and discuss implications of our empirical results.},

Accurate measurement of profits from microenterprises is therefore critical for studying poverty and inequality, measuring the returns to education, and evaluating the success of microfinance programs. However, a myriad of problems plague the measurement of profits. This paper reports on a variety of different experiments conducted to better understand the importance of some of these problems, and to draw recommendations for collecting profit data. In particular, we (i) examine how far we can reconcile self-reported profits and reports of revenue minus expenses through more detailed questions; (ii) examine recall errors in sales, and report on the results of experiments which randomly allocated account books to firms; and (iii) asked firms how much firms like theirs underreport sales in surveys like ours, and had research assistants observe the firms at random times 15--16 times during a month to provide measures for comparison. We conclude that firms underreport revenues by about 30\%, that account diaries have significant impacts on both revenues and expenses, but not on profits, and that simply asking profits provides a more accurate measure of firm profits than detailed questions on revenues and expenses.},

These data enable detailed analysis of patterns of perpetrator/victim and belligerent groups over time, and show how violence changed over the four years following the height of armed conflict in 2003--05. During the reference period, violent incidents were sporadic and diverse and included: battles between the major combatants; battles among subgroups of combatant coalitions that were ostensibly allied; inter-tribal conflict; incidents of one-sided violence against civilians by different parties; and incidents of banditry. The conflict as a whole defies easy categorization. The exercise illustrates the limits of existing frameworks for categorizing armed violence and underlines the importance of rigorous microlevel data collection and improved models for understanding the dynamics of collective violence. By analogy with the use of the epidemiological data for infectious diseases to help design emergency health interventions, we argue for improved use of data on lethal violence in the design and implementation of peacekeeping, humanitarian and conflict resolution interventions.},

Therefore, community development practice based on this understanding of social capital is, and will continue to be, similarly flawed. The article further argues that instead of Putnam's understanding of social capital, community development practice would be better served by returning to the way the concept was used by Glenn Loury and Pierre Bourdieu and concludes with a discussion of how these alternative theories of social capital can be realized in community development practice.},

In estimating AIDS mortality attributable to IDU, it is important to take account of premature mortality rates from other causes to ensure that AIDS related mortality among injecting drug users (IDUs) is not overestimated. The current review provides estimates of the excess non-AIDS mortality among IDUs. Method: Searches were conducted with Medline, PsycINFO, and the Web of Science. The authors also searched reference lists of identified papers and an earlier literature review by English et al (1995). Crude mortality rates (CMRs) were derived from data on the number of deaths, period of follow up, and number of participants. In estimating the all-cause mortality, two rates were calculated: one that included all cohort studies identified in the search, and one that only included studies that reported on AIDS deaths in their cohort. This provided lower and upper mortality rates, respectively. Results: The current paper derived weighted mortality rates based upon cohort studies that included 179 885 participants, 1 219 422 person-years of observation, and 16 593 deaths. The weighted crude AIDS mortality rate from studies that reported AIDS deaths was approximately 0.78\% per annum. The median estimated non-AIDS mortality rate was 1.08\% per annum. Conclusions: Illicit drug users have a greatly increased risk of premature death and mortality due to AIDS forms a significant part of that increased risk; it is, however, only part of that risk. Future work needs to examine mortality rates among IDUs in developing countries, and collect data on the relation between HIV and increased mortality due to all causes among this group.},

Despite limited central supervision, diaries elicited a strong response, complemented standard surveys in a number of respects and were less affected by problems of respondent fatigue than expected.

While data comparing teen self-report with biological measures are limited, adult studies identify varying degrees of under-reporting. METHODSHair analyses for cocaine, opiates and marijuana were compared to confidential teen self- and parent-reported teen drug use in a longitudinal cohort of {$>$}400 high-risk urban teens and parents. RESULTSBoth teens and parents substantially underreported recent teen cocaine and opiate use. However, compared with parents, teens were more likely to deny biomarker-verified cocaine use. Teen specimens (hair) were 52 times more likely to identify cocaine use compared with self-report. Parent hair analyses for cocaine and opiate use were 6.5 times and 5.5 times, respectively, more likely to indicate drug use than were parental self-report. The lack of concordance between self-report and bioassay occurred despite participant's knowledge that a "certificate of confidentiality" protected both teen and adult participants, and that the biological specimens would be tested for drugs. CONCLUSIONSThese findings confirm prior reports of adult under-reporting of their own drug use while extending our understanding of teen's self-admitted drug use. The lack of concordance between teen self- or parent-reported teen drug use and biomarkers confirm our concerns that both teen- and parent-reported teen drug use is limited, at least for youth in high-risk urban settings. Methods of ascertainment other than self- or parent-report must be considered when health care providers, researchers and public health agencies attempt to estimate teen drug-use prevalence.}

The entropy of a population measures the variability of the contribution of the different age classes to the stationary age distribution. The reproductive potential measures the mean of the contribution of the different age classes to the growth rate. Using a relation between these measures and the Malthusian parameter, it is shown that in a random mating population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and under slow selection, the rate of change of entropy is equal to the genetic variance in entropy minus the genetic covariance of entropy and reproductive potential. This result is an analogue of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection.}

We conducted population-based telephone surveys in four North Carolina counties to determine the number of social interactions between individuals during the 2007--2008 influenza season. Influenza activity was monitored through sentinel medical practices. Among 3845 adults, the number of social contacts varied with age, was lower on weekends than on weekdays, and further decreased during school holiday periods. Adults with influenza-like illnesses had fewer social contacts. Adults' contacts in the community setting increased during periods of peak influenza activity. Among 290 children, potential contacts (i.e. other people in the same location) were lowest among preschool-age children and decreased on weekends and during school holidays. In adjusted analyses, children's potential social contacts did not change during periods of peak influenza activity. These results should be useful for modelling influenza epidemics and pandemics and in planning mitigation and response strategies.},

  abstract = {This article investigates estimation of finite population totals in the presence of univariate or multivariate auxiliary information. Estimation is equivalent to attaching weights to the survey data. We focus attention on the several weighting systems that can be associated with a given amount of auxiliary information and derive a weighting system with the aid of a distance measure and a set of calibration equations. We briefly mention an application to the case in which the information consists of known marginal counts in a two- or multi-way table, known as generalized raking. The general regression estimator (GREG) was conceived with multivariate auxiliary information in mind. Ordinarily, this estimator is justified by a regression relationship between the study variable y and the auxiliary vector x. But we note that the GREG can be derived by a different route by focusing instead on the weights. The ordinary sampling weights of the kth observation is 1/{$\pi$}k , where {$\pi$}k is the inclusion probability of k. We show that the weights implied by the GREG are as close as possible, according to a given distance measure, to the 1/{$\pi$}k while respecting side conditions called calibration equations. These state that the sample sum of the weighted auxiliary variable values must equal the known population total for that auxiliary variable. That is, the calibrated weights must give perfect estimates when applied to each auxiliary variable. That is a consistency check that appeals to many practitioners, because a strong correlation between the auxiliary variables and the study variable means that the weights that perform well for the auxiliary variable also should perform well for the study variable. The GREG uses the auxiliary information efficiently, so the estimates are precise; however, the individual weights are not always without reproach. For example, negative weights can occur, and in some applications this does not make sense. It is natural to seek the root of the dissatisfaction in the underlying distance measure. Consequently, we allow alternative distance measures that satisfy only a set of minimal requirements. Each distance measure leads, via the calibration equations, to a specific weighting system and thereby to a new estimator. These estimators form a family of calibration estimators. We show that the GREG is a first approximation to all other members of the family; all are asymptotically equivalent to the GREG, and the variance estimator already known for the GREG is recommended for use in any other member of the family. Numerical features of the weights and ease of computation become more than anything else the bases for choosing between the estimators. The reasoning is applied to calibration on known marginals of a two-way frequency table. Our family of distance measures leads in this case to a family of generalized raking procedures, of which classical raking ratio is one.},

  abstract = {The medieval Black Death (c. 1347-1351) was one of the most devastating epidemics in human history. It killed tens of millions of Europeans, and recent analyses have shown that the disease targeted elderly adults and individuals who had been previously exposed to physiological stressors. Following the epidemic, there were improvements in standards of living, particularly in dietary quality for all socioeconomic strata. This study investigates whether the combination of the selective mortality of the Black Death and post-epidemic improvements in standards of living had detectable effects on survival and mortality in London. Samples are drawn from several pre- and post-Black Death London cemeteries. The pre-Black Death sample comes from the Guildhall Yard (n = 75) and St. Nicholas Shambles (n = 246) cemeteries, which date to the 11th--12th centuries, and from two phases within the St. Mary Spital cemetery, which date to between 1120-1300 (n = 143). The St. Mary Graces cemetery (n = 133) was in use from 1350--1538 and thus represents post-epidemic demographic conditions. By applying Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Gompertz hazard model to transition analysis age estimates, and controlling for changes in birth rates, this study examines differences in survivorship and mortality risk between the pre- and post-Black Death populations of London. The results indicate that there are significant differences in survival and mortality risk, but not birth rates, between the two time periods, which suggest improvements in health following the Black Death, despite repeated outbreaks of plague in the centuries after the Black Death.}

  abstract = {The basic reproduction number (0) is arguably the most important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology. The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of (0) where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of (0). We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number (0). Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that (0) defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter r, the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that (0) {$>$} 1 if and only if r {$>$} 0, and (0) = 1 if and only if r = 0.},

In practice, widespread variation exists in how child labor is measured. Questionnaire modules vary across countries and within countries over time along several dimensions, including respondent type and the structure of the questionnaire. Little is known about the effect of these differences on child labor statistics. This paper presents the results from a randomized survey experiment in Tanzania focusing on two survey design choices: different questionnaire design to classify children work and proxy response versus self-reporting. Use of a short module compared with a more detailed questionnaire has a statistically significant effect, especially on child labor force participation rates, and, to a lesser extent, on working hours. Proxy reports do not differ significantly from a child's self-report. Further analysis demonstrates that survey design choices affect the coefficient estimates of some determinants of child labor in a child labor supply equation. The results suggest that low-cost changes to questionnaire design will potentially clarify the concept of work for respondents.},

In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages.},

While our results are not conclusive, we find evidence that a large portion of the effect of homeownership on these investments may come from lower mobility rates for homeowners.

Finally, across cities and counties, areas with more homeowners have lower government spending, but spend a larger share of their government budget on education and highways.}

In the rest of the world, particularly in Asia, color and colorism have also been important but have evolved separately from the relatively new concepts of race and racism. In recent years, however, color consciousness and white supremacy appear to have been increasingly united, globalized, and commodified, as exemplified by the global multibillion-dollar skin-lightening industry.

  abstract = {We address the problem of cultural diversification by studying selection on cultural ideas that colonize human hosts and using diversification of religions as a conceptual example. In analogy to studying the evolution of pathogens or symbionts colonizing animal hosts, we use models for host--pathogen dynamics known from theoretical epidemiology. In these models, religious content colonizes individual humans. Rates of transmission of ideas between humans, i.e., transmission of cultural content, and rates of loss of ideas (loss of belief) are determined by the phenotype of the cultural content, and by interactions between hosts carrying different ideas. In particular, based on the notion that cultural non-conformism can be negative frequency-dependent (for example, religion can lead to oppression of lower classes and emergence of non-conformism and dissent once a religious belief has reached dominance), we assume that the rate of loss of belief increases as the number of humans colonized by a particular religious phenotype increases. This generates frequency-dependent selection on cultural content, and we use evolutionary theory to show that this frequency dependence can lead to the emergence of coexisting clusters of different cultural types. The different clusters correspond to different cultural traditions, and hence our model describes the emergence of distinct descendant cultures from a single ancestral culture in the absence of any geographical isolation.},

Reducing the MMR is one of the Millennium Development Goals and the UN Global strategy for women's and children's health mobilised multiple resources and commitments to accelerate this objective.1 However MMR estimates and accurate identification of the causes of maternal death are still a complex and difficult challenge. In most developing country settings, owing to the lack of complete and accurate civil registration systems, MMR estimates are based on data from a variety of alternative sources including censuses, household surveys, reproductive age mortality studies and verbal autopsies.2 The WHO classified 183 countries/territories according to the availability and quality of maternal mortality data: 67 countries (covering 17\% of births) having complete civil registration data with good attribution of causes of death, 96 countries (covering 81\% of births) having incomplete civil registration and/or other types of maternal mortality data and 20 countries (covering 2\% of births) lacking national data on maternal mortality. For the last two categories, a regression model has been developed to estimate maternal mortality figures.3 The Demographic and Health Surveys Program4 uses the sisterhood method for Maternal Mortality estimations. This method remains the major source of empirical data on maternal mortality in developing countries, although it presents notable limitations. All deaths with unknown status about pregnancy are in fact classified as non-maternal and almost half of the surveys have more {\dots}},

In the absence of a vaccine, controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 depends on social distancing measures, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders. Infectious disease epidemiologists create models to test the effects of these different interventions and to predict their impact on different populations. One key input to these models is data on social contact and mixing patterns. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of this type of data for the US. The Minnesota Department of Health and University of Minnesota launched the Minnesota Social Contact Study (MN SCS) in order to capture social contact and mixing pattern data for MN as different social distancing measures are enacted. This report describes the MN SCS survey and survey methodology. We highlight key differences between the MN SCS and the most widely cited and used social contact survey based on data from eight European countries in 2006. We conclude by highlighting changes others may consider when adopting the survey for use in other populations. A copy of the survey instrument is included in the appendix.},

  abstract = {There are now a growing number of applications of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) in population health and epidemiological studies. MRP uses multilevel regression to model individual survey responses as a function of demographic and geographic covariates. Estimated mean outcome values for each demographic--geographic respondent subtype are then weighted by the proportions of each subtype in the population to produce an overall population-level estimate. We recently reported an extensive case study of a large nationwide survey and found that MRP performed favorably compared to conventional survey sampling weights for the estimation of population descriptive quantities in a highly selected sample. In this study, we aimed to evaluate, by way of a simulation experiment, both the accuracy and precision of MRP versus survey sampling weights in the context of large population health studies. While much of the research into MRP has been focused on U.S. political and social science, we considered an alternative population structure of smaller size and with notably fewer geographic subsets. We explored the impact on MRP performance of sample size, model misspecification, interactions, and the addition of a geographic-level covariate. MRP was found to achieve generally superior performance in both accuracy and precision at both the national and state levels. Results were generally robust to model misspecification, and MRP performance was further improved by the inclusion of a geographic-level covariate. These findings offer further evidence that MRP provides a promising analytic approach for addressing participation bias in the estimation of population descriptive quantities from large-scale health surveys and cohort studies.},

We use parameter estimates based on the federally administered Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 combined with known characteristics of state populations from the American Community Survey in order to estimate postsecondary attendance rates by income in each of the states. Our application of Bayesian techniques for estimation and inference allow us to make appropriate statements of uncertainty regarding our estimates, including the probability that low-income young people will attend higher education in a given state. We find substantial variation in the postsecondary attendance rates of low-income young people, ranging from 34 percent in some states to over 54 percent in others. Our results also provide evidence that the within-state difference between low-income and middle/high-income college attendance rates ranges from 20 to 28 percentage points. Our validity checks show that our estimates follow expected patterns based on estimates from other surveys.},

In this study, data on all recorded COVID-19 deaths in Sweden up to May 7, 2020 are linked to high-quality and accurate individual-level background data from administrative registers of the total population. By means of individual-level survival analysis we demonstrate that being male, having less individual income, lower education, not being married all independently predict a higher risk of death from COVID-19 and from all other causes of death. Being an immigrant from a low- or middle-income country predicts higher risk of death from COVID-19 but not for all other causes of death. The main message of this work is that the interaction of the virus causing COVID-19 and its social environment exerts an unequal burden on the most disadvantaged members of society.},

  abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to discuss problems that occur in questionnaire responses and how cognitive interviewing can be used to identify problematic questions prior to using the questionnaire in the field. Background. Questionnaire design involves developing wording that is clear, unambiguous and permits respondents successfully to answer the question that is asked. However, a number of problems in relation to respondents' understanding and successfully completing questionnaires have been identified. Cognitive interviewing, an amalgamation of cognitive psychology and survey methodology, has been developed to identify problematic questions that may elicit response error. The overall aim is to use cognitive theory to understand how respondents perceive and interpret questions and to identify potential problems that may arise in prospective survey questionnaires. Methods. A literature review is used to examine the process of questionnaire design and how cognitive interviewing can be used to reduce sampling error and increase questionnaire response rates. Findings. Cognitive interviewing involves interviewers asking survey respondents to think out loud as they go through a survey questionnaire and tell them everything they are thinking. This allows understanding of the questionnaire from the respondents' perspective rather than that of the researchers. Cognitive interviews have been used in a number of areas in health care research to pretest and validate questionnaires and to ensure high response rates. Interviewing has been found to be highly effective in developing questionnaires for age specific groups (children and adolescents) and in ascertaining respondents' understanding in health surveys prior to distribution. However, cognitive interviews have been criticized for being overly subjective and artificial. Conclusion: Cognitive interviews are a positive addition to current methods of pretesting questionnaires prior to distribution to the sample. They are most valuable in pretesting questions that are complex, where questions are sensitive and intrusive and for specific groups for whom questionnaire completion may pose particular difficulties.},

The constraint is partly cognitive (ultimately determined by some aspect of brain volume) and partly one of time. Friendships (but not necessarily kin relationships) are maintained by investing time in them, and failure to do so results in an inexorable deterioration in the quality of a relationship. The Internet, and in particular the rise of social networking sites (SNSs), raises the possibility that digital media might allow us to circumvent some or all of these constraints. This allows us to test the importance of these constraints in limiting human sociality. Although the recency of SNSs means that there have been relatively few studies, those that are available suggest that, in general, the ability to broadcast to many individuals at once, and the possibilities this provides in terms of continuously updating our understanding of network members' behaviour and thoughts, do not allow larger networks to be maintained. This may be because only relatively weak quality relationships can be maintained without face-to-face interaction.},

A one- time, one-hour group-administered questionnaire on HIV and sexual behavior had an equally large impact on teen pregnancy without improving knowledge - it instead made the risks more salient and changed subjective beliefs. We find no effects among urban schoolgirls, who are more exposed to information and experience much lower rates of teenage pregnancy under the status quo.},

This question is central to our understanding of a wide variety of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, but has remained difficult to investigate empirically due to the inherent problem of distinguishing those who are telling the truth from those who are misreporting. This article proposes a solution to this problem. It develops a method to model, within a multivariate regression context, whether survey respondents provide one response to a sensitive item in a list experiment, but answer otherwise when asked to reveal that belief openly in response to a direct question. As an empirical application, the method is applied to an original large-scale list experiment to investigate whether those on the ideological left are more likely to misreport their responses to questions about prejudice than those on the right. The method is implemented for researchers as open-source software.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical models, based on data describing normal patterns of social mixing, are used to understand epidemics in order to predict patterns of disease spread and plan interventions and responses. However, individuals who are ill show behavioural changes that affect their social mixing patterns and predictive models should take into account these changes if they are to be effective. OBJECTIVES: To describe and quantify the changes in (1) social contact behaviour experienced by individuals when they are ill with pandemic H1N1 influenza (swine flu) and (2) mixing patterns of school children that take place as a result of swine flu-related school closures. METHODS: For the first part of the study, a self-completed questionnaire-based study was carried out in the autumn/winter of 2009-10. The study population was individuals who had been diagnosed with swine flu and who received a swine flu antiviral prescription from an antiviral distribution centre (ADC). It consisted of an initial survey to be filled in when participants were symptomatic with swine flu and a follow-up survey to be filled in when they had recovered. Each part of the questionnaire had two sections: patient details and a contact diary. The second part of the study was adapted to quantify the difference in mixing patterns of pupils between the school term and the half-term holiday as school closures did not occur during the study period. Eight schools participated and questionnaire packs were distributed to them, containing two surveys: one to be filled in during the school term and one during the spring half-term holiday. RESULTS: For the patient study, approximately 3800 surveys were distributed by 31 ADCs. Overall, 317 responses to the initial survey were received and 179 participants returned the follow-up survey. For all types of a contact, except contacts made at home, there were highly significant differences in contact behaviour (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p {$<$} 0.001). Individuals made substantially fewer contacts when they were ill than when they were well. Analysis showed that returning to work was the most significant predictor of increased numbers of contacts. Also, the greater the change in the number of symptoms reported, the greater the change in the number of contacts. For the school study, approximately 1100 questionnaire packs were distributed and 134 responses were received, with 119 paired contact diaries. Pupils reported on average 18.51 contacts each day during term time and 9.24 during the half-term holiday - a reduction of over 50\% and a highly significant change (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from this study suggests that ill individuals make substantial changes to their social contact patterns. These changes are strongly linked to absence from work and the severity of the reported illness. Epidemiological modellers should therefore consider the implications of illness-related behavioural changes on model predictions. Future studies to measure the extent of behavioural change in a broader cross-section of infected cases could be valuable, along with more detailed studies of the social contact patterns of school children, focusing on differences between school terms and school holidays.},

Until now, little information has been available to quantify how people's mixing patterns change over time. Here, we present the results of an internet-based survey of social mixing patterns that was carried out in the UK throughout the 2009 pandemic. We show that school holidays resulted in a substantial drop in the number of social contacts made each day, particularly between children. To test whether these measured patterns of social mixing could explain the observed epidemic, we used our mixing data in a simple mathematical model of influenza spread. We found that changing social contact behaviour could explain levels of infection in the community, and conclude that the timing of school terms was responsible for the shape of the influenza epidemic.},

A contact network represents individuals in a host population as nodes and the interactions among them that may lead to the transmission of infection as edges. New avenues for data collection in recent years have afforded us the opportunity to collect individual- and population-scale information to empirically describe the patterns of contact within host populations. Here, we present some of the current challenges in measuring empirical contact networks. We address fundamental questions such as defining contact; measurement of non-trivial contact properties; practical issues of bounding measurement of contact networks in space, time and scope; exploiting proxy information about contacts; dealing with missing data. Finally, we consider the privacy and ethical issues surrounding the collection of contact network data.},

A common view is that social interventions that lower pathogen transmission will indirectly select lower virulence because of a trade-off between transmission and virulence. Here, we argue that there is little theoretical justification and no empirical evidence for this plan. Although a trade-off model might apply to some pathogens, the mechanism appears too weak for rapid selection of substantial changes in virulence. Direct selection against virulence itself might be a more rewarding approach to managing the evolution of virulence.}

The standard approximate intervals based on maximum likelihood theory, {\^{\texttheta}} {\textpm} {\^undefined}z\textsuperscript{({$\alpha$})}, can be quite misleading. In practice, tricks based on transformations, bias corrections, and so forth, are often used to improve their accuracy. The bootstrap confidence intervals discussed in this article automatically incorporate such tricks without requiring the statistician to think them through for each new application, at the price of a considerable increase in computational effort. The new intervals incorporate an improvement over previously suggested methods, which results in second-order correctness in a wide variety of problems. In addition to parametric families, bootstrap intervals are also developed for nonparametric situations.}

The Bayes rule will still produce nice looking estimates and credible intervals, but these lack the logical force that is attached to experience-based priors and require further justification. The paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple formula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate. The same simulations as required for the point estimate also produce the standard deviation. Exponential family models make the calculations particularly simple and bring in a connection to the parametric bootstrap.}

The aim of this research was to systematically review systematic reviews on SC and health, in order to provide an overview of existing evidence and to identify strategies for future research. Nine databases were searched for key words that could fall under the broad umbrella of SC and health outcomes. We screened 4941 titles and abstracts and read 187 reviews before retaining 20 of them. A critical appraisal of each review was conducted. The reviews show there is good evidence to suggest that SC predicts better mental and physical health, and indicators of SC are protective against mortality. At the same time, many reviews also found numerous non-significant and negative relationships that are important to consider. It was unclear whether SC interventions for health were really improving SC, or other aspects of the social environment. Overall, this research shows that evidence on how various aspects of SC affect different health outcomes for different actors remains unclear. Intergroup and lifecourse perspectives could help clarify this link. Future research could benefit from conceptualizing the link between SC and health in a what, who, where, when, why and how framework.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground Bangladesh is one of the only nine Countdown countries that are on track to achieve the primary target of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 by 2015. It is also the only low-income or middle-income country with two large, nationally-representative, high-quality household surveys focused on the measurement of maternal mortality and service use. Methods We use data from the 2001 and 2010 Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Surveys to measure change in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and from these and six Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys to measure changes in factors potentially related to such change. We estimate the changes in risk of maternal death between the two surveys using Poisson regression. Findings The MMR fell from 322 deaths per 100\hphantom{,}000 livebirths (95\% CI 253--391) in 1998--2001 to 194 deaths per 100\hphantom{,}000 livebirths (149--238) in 2007--10, an annual rate of decrease of 5{$\cdot$}6\%. This decrease rate is slightly higher than that required (5{$\cdot$}5\%) to achieve the MDG target between 1990 and 2015. The key contribution to this decrease was a drop in mortality risk mainly due to improved access to and use of health facilities. Additionally, a number of favourable changes occurred during this period: fertility decreased and the proportion of births associated with high risk to the mother fell; income per head increased sharply and the poverty rate fell; and the education levels of women of reproductive age improved substantially. We estimate that 52\% of maternal deaths that would have occurred in 2010 in view of 2001 rates were averted because of decreases in fertility and risk of maternal death. Interpretation The decrease in MMR in Bangladesh seems to have been the result of factors both within and outside the health sector. This finding holds important lessons for other countries as the world discusses and decides on the post-MDG goals and strategies. For Bangladesh, this case study provides a strong rationale for the pursuit of a broader developmental agenda alongside increased and accelerated investments in improving access to and quality of public and private health-care facilities providing maternal health in Bangladesh.

We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Unfortunately, a unique identifier that unambiguously links records is often unavailable, and data may contain missing and inaccurate information. These problems are severe especially when merging large-scale administrative records. We develop a fast and scalable algorithm to implement a canonical model of probabilistic record linkage that has many advantages over deterministic methods frequently used by social scientists. The proposed methodology efficiently handles millions of observations while accounting for missing data and measurement error, incorporating auxiliary information, and adjusting for uncertainty about merging in post-merge analyses. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our algorithm in realistic scenarios. We also apply our methodology to merging campaign contribution records, survey data, and nationwide voter files. An open-source software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},

Some blame misreporting due to social desirability, others attribute it to non-response bias and the accuracy of turnout validation. While we can validate self-reported turnout by directly linking surveys with administrative records, most existing studies rely on proprietary merging algorithms with limited scientific transparency and yield conflicting results. To shed a light on this debate, we apply a canonical probabilistic record linkage model, implemented via the open-source software package fastLink, to merge two major election studies the American National Election Studies and the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey with a national voter fille of over 180 million records. For both studies, fastLink successfully produces validated turnout rates close to the actual turnout rates, leading to public-use validated turnout data for the two studies. Using these merged data sets, we find that the bias of self-reported turnout originates primarily from misreporting rather than non-response. Our findings suggest that those who are educated and interested in politics are more likely to over-report turnout. Finally, we show that fastLink performs as well as a proprietary algorithm.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Regression models are often used to explain the relative risk of infectious diseases among groups. For example, overrepresentation of immigrants among COVID-19 cases has been found in multiple countries. Several studies apply regression models to investigate whether different risk factors can explain this overrepresentation among immigrants without considering dependence between the cases. Methods:{\enspace} We study the appropriateness of traditional statistical regression methods for identifying risk factors for infectious diseases, by a simulation study. We model infectious disease spread by a simple, population-structured version of an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)-model, which is one of the most famous and well-established models for infectious disease spread. The population is thus divided into different sub-groups. We vary the contact structure between the sub-groups of the population. We analyse the relation between individual-level risk of infection and group-level relative risk. We analyse whether Poisson regression estimators can capture the true, underlying parameters of transmission. We assess both the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of the estimated regression coefficients. Results:{\enspace} We illustrate that there is no clear relationship between differences in individual characteristics and grouplevel overrepresentation ---small differences on the individual level can result in arbitrarily high overrepresentation. We demonstrate that individual risk of infection cannot be properly defined without simultaneous specification of the infection level of the population. We argue that the estimated regression coefficients are not interpretable and show that it is not possible to adjust for other variables by standard regression methods. Finally, we illustrate that regression models can result in the significance of variables unrelated to infection risk in the constructed simulation example (e.g. ethnicity), particularly when a large proportion of contacts is within the same group. Conclusions:{\enspace} Traditional regression models which are valid for modelling risk between groups for non-communicable diseases are not valid for infectious diseases. By applying such methods to identify risk factors of infectious diseases, one risks ending up with wrong conclusions. Output from such analyses should therefore be treated with great caution.},

This study draws on a unique linkage between the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and state voter files to characterize voting trajectories in later life and explore their determinants.Using sequence analysis, we identify 5 voting typologies based on turnout and voting methods over 8 biennial elections. Using multinomial logistic and Poisson regressions, we examine the role of physical, cognitive, and mental health and wealth in shaping enfranchisement and civic participation at older ages.Health and wealth are both positively associated with voter turnout, but the negative impact of poor health on voting declines with increasing wealth. Voting at the polls and early voting are more common among healthier older adults, whereas absentee voting is more common among older voters who are more affluent, less healthy, or both. Among those less wealthy, absentee methods mitigate the impact of poor health for previously active voters, but do not compensate for a lower turnout rate. In addition to physical and cognitive limitations, emotional difficulties and depression reduce turnout, particularly among the least wealthy.In this sample of older, largely White, primarily Midwestern committed voters, civic participation at older ages is shaped by individual experiences with wealth and health across the life course as well as political structures that facilitate or restrict the ability of individuals to consistently participate in elections.}

Its central finding is that, as long as fertility is below replacement, a constant number and age distribution of immigrants (with fixed fertility and mortality schedules) lead to a stationary population. Neither the level of the net reproduction rate nor the size of the annual immigration affects this conclusion; a stationary population eventually emerges. How this stationary population is created is studied, as is the generational distribution of the constant annual stream of births and of the total population. It is also shown that immigrants and their early descendants may have fertility well above replacement (as long as later generations adopt and maintain fertility below replacement), and the outcome will still be a long-run stationary population.}

Our model arises when we incorporate very general recombination mechanisms into a previous model of mutation and selection from Steinsaltz, Evans and Wachter (2005) and take the relative strength of mutation and selection to be sufficiently small. The resulting dynamical system is a flow of measures on the space of loci. Each such measure is the intensity measure of a Poisson random measure on the space of loci: the points of a realization of the random measure record the set of loci at which the genotype of a uniformly chosen individual differs from a reference wild type due to an accumulation of ancestral mutations. Our motivation for working in such a general setting is to provide a basis for understanding mutation-driven changes in age-specific demographic schedules that arise from the complex interaction of many genes, and hence to develop a framework for understanding the evolution of aging. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the dynamical system, provide conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium states, and prove that our continuous-time dynamical system is the limit of a sequence of discrete-time infinite population mutation-selection-recombination models in the standard asymptotic regime where selection and mutation are weak relative to recombination and both scale at the same infinitesimal rate in the limit.},

However, size estimates of MSM populations have not been conducted with sufficient frequency and rigor because of the difficulty, high cost and stigma associated with reaching such populations. This study examined an innovative and simple method for estimating the size of the MSM population in Japan. We combined an internet survey with the network scale-up method, a social network method for estimating the size of hard-to-reach populations, for the first time in Japan. An internet survey was conducted among 1,500 internet users who registered with a nationwide internet-research agency. The survey participants were asked how many members of particular groups with known population sizes (firepersons, police officers, and military personnel) they knew as acquaintances. The participants were also asked to identify the number of their acquaintances whom they understood to be MSM. Using these survey results with the network scale-up method, the personal network size and MSM population size were estimated. The personal network size was estimated to be 363.5 regardless of the sex of the acquaintances and 174.0 for only male acquaintances. The estimated MSM prevalence among the total male population in Japan was 0.0402\% without adjustment, and 2.87\% after adjusting for the transmission error of MSM. The estimated personal network size and MSM prevalence seen in this study were comparable to those from previous survey results based on the direct-estimation method. Estimating population sizes through combining an internet survey with the network scale-up method appeared to be an effective method from the perspectives of rapidity, simplicity, and low cost as compared with more-conventional methods.}

Simple use of these devices can offer the prospect of more timely data entry and greater accuracy in guiding respondents through skip patterns. Further benefits are possible through the use of more complex consistency checks. We use PDAs to measure sales and profits for microenterprises, which are notoriously noisy. Consistency checks in the cross-section compare sales and profits, while those in the panel query responses which result in large changes from one period to the next. Cross-sectional checks also served as a second prompt in the case of missing profits. These checks do succeed in reducing the standard deviation and in increasing the correlation of the observations for which corrections are made. However, we find that the vast majority of large changes in enterprise sales and profits are confirmed by firm owners as genuine, highlighting the volatility of income in this sector. As a result, the overall impact of these consistency checks on the full sample is rather limited, suggesting that while such checks are useful if computerized forms of data collection are being used, the consistency checks per se are not a strong reason for using computerized data collection in collecting firm profits and sales.},

  abstract = {Advertisers are demanding more accurate estimates of the impact of targeted advertisements, yet no study proposes an appropriate methodology to analyze the effectiveness of a targeted advertising campaign, and there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of targeted advertising as a whole. The targeted population is more likely to convert from advertising so the response lift between the targeted and untargeted group to the advertising is likely an overestimate of the impact of targeted advertising. We propose a difference-in-differences estimator to account for this selection bias by decomposing the impact of targeting into selection bias and treatment effects components. Using several large-scale online advertising campaigns, we test the effectiveness of targeted advertising on brand-related searches and clickthrough rates. We find that the treatment effect on the targeted group is about twice as large for brand-related searches, but naively estimating this effect without taking into account selection bias leads to an overestimation of the lift from targeting on brand-related searches by almost 1,000\%.},

  abstract = {The basic reproduction number of an infection, R0, is the average number of secondary infections generated by a single typical infective individual in a totally susceptible population. It is directly related to the effort required to eliminate infection. We consider statistical methods for estimating R0 from age-stratified serological survey data. The main difficulty is indeterminacy, since the contacts between individuals of different ages are not observed. We show that, given an estimate of the average age-specific hazard of infection, a particular leading left eigenfunction is required to specify R0. We review existing methods of estimation in the light of this indeterminacy. We suggest using data from several infections transmitted via the same route, and we propose that the choice of model be guided by a criterion based on similarity of their contact functions. This approach also allows model uncertainty to be taken into account. If one infection induces no lasting immunity, we show that the only additional assumption required to estimate R0 is that the contact function is symmetric. When matched data on two or more infections transmitted by the same route are available, the methods may be extended to incorporate the effect of individual heterogeneity. The approach can also be applied in partially vaccinated populations and to populations comprising loosely linked communities. The methods are illustrated with data on hepatitis A, mumps, rubella, parvovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and measles infection.},

It offers advantages over other size estimation techniques, but the basic scale-up estimator depends on problematic modeling assumptions. We propose a new generalized scale-up estimator that does not suffer from these problems. The new estimator can be used in realistic settings, like populations with non-random social mixing and imperfect social awareness, and it can accommodate data collection with complex sample designs and incomplete sampling frames. However, the generalized scale-up estimator also requires data from two samples: one from the frame population and one from the hidden population. In some situations these data from the hidden population can be collected by adding a small number of questions to already-planned studies. For other situations, we develop interpretable adjustment factors that can be applied to the basic scale-up estimator. We conclude with practical recommendations for the design and analysis of future studies.},

OBJECTIVE We show that when a population can be partitioned into subgroups, the death rate for the entire population can be written as the weighted harmonic mean of the death rates in each subgroup, where the weights are given by the numbers of deaths in each subgroup. This decomposition can be generalized to other types of occurrence-exposure rate. Using different weights, the death rate for the entire population can also be expressed as an arithmetic mean of the death rates in each subgroup. CONTRIBUTION We use these relationships as a starting point for investigating how demographers can correctly aggregate rates across non-overlapping subgroups. Our analysis reveals conceptual links between classic demographic models and length-biased sampling. To illustrate how the harmonic mean can suggest new interpretations of demographic relationships, we present as an application a new expression for the frailty of the dying, given a standard demographic frailty model.},

These strong social distancing measures will be effective in controlling the spread of the virus only if they are able to reduce the amount of close interpersonal contact in a population. It is therefore crucial for researchers and policymakers to empirically measure the extent to which these policies have actually reduced interpersonal interaction. We created the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Study (BICS) to help achieve this goal. Here, we report the first set of BICS results, based on data collected in the United States between March 22, 2020 and April 8, 2020. We find evidence that rates of interpersonal contact have greatly been reduced at all ages in the United States.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The network scale-up method is a promising technique that uses sampled social network data to estimate the sizes of epidemiologically important hidden populations, such as sex workers and people who inject illicit drugs. Although previous scale-up research has focused exclusively on networks of acquaintances, we show that the type of personal network about which survey respondents are asked to report is a potentially crucial parameter that researchers are free to vary. This generalization leads to a method that is more flexible and potentially more accurate. In 2011, we conducted a large, nationally representative survey experiment in Rwanda that randomized respondents to report about one of 2 different personal networks. Our results showed that asking respondents for less information can, somewhat surprisingly, produce more accurate size estimates. We also estimated the sizes of 4 key populations at risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection in Rwanda. Our estimates were higher than earlier estimates from Rwanda but lower than international benchmarks. Finally, in this article we develop a new sensitivity analysis framework and use it to assess the possible biases in our estimates. Our design can be customized and extended for other settings, enabling researchers to continue to improve the network scale-up method.},

However, studying mortality at old ages is challenging because the data are sparse: numbers of survivors and deaths get smaller and smaller with age. I show how to address this challenge by using principled model selection techniques to empirically evaluate theoretical mortality models. I test nine models of old-age death rates by fitting them to 360 high-quality data sets on cohort mortality after age 80. Models that allow for the possibility of decelerating death rates tend to fit better than models that assume exponentially increasing death rates. No single model is capable of universally explaining observed old-age mortality patterns, but the log-quadratic model most consistently predicts well. Patterns of model fit differ by country and sex. I discuss possible mechanisms, including sample size, period effects, and regional or cultural factors that may be important keys to understanding patterns of old-age mortality. I introduce mortfit, a freely available R package that enables researchers to extend the analysis to other models, age ranges, and data sources.},

  abstract = {We prove the following inequality: for every positive integer \$n\$ and every collection \$X\_1, {\textbackslash}ldots, X\_n\$ of nonnegative independent random variables, each with expectation 1, the probability that their sum remains below \$n+1\$ is at least \${\textbackslash}alpha {$>$} 0\$. Our proof produces a value of \${\textbackslash}alpha = 1/13 {\textbackslash}simeq 0.077\$, but we conjecture that the inequality also holds with \${\textbackslash}alpha = 1/e {\textbackslash}simeq 0.368\$. As an example for the use of the new inequality, we consider the problem of estimating the average degree of a graph by querying the degrees of some of its vertices. We show the following threshold behavior: approximation factors above 2 require far fewer queries than approximation factors below 2. The new inequality is used in order to get tight (up to multiplicative constant factors) relations between the number of queries and the quality of the approximation. We show how the degree approximation algorithm can be used in order to quickly find those edges in a network that belong to many shortest paths.},

  abstract = {It is reasonable to suppose that individuals use the number of firends that their friends have as one basis for determining whether they, themselves, have an adequate number of friends. This article shows that, if individuals compare themselves with their friends, it is likely that most of them will feel relatively inadequate. Data on friendship drawn from James Coleman's (1961) classic study The Adolescent Society are used to illustratite the phenomenon that most people have fewer friends have. The logic underlying the phenomenon is mathematically explored, showing that the mean number of friends of friends is always greater than the mean number of friends of individuals. Further analysis shows that the proportion of individuals who have fewer friends than the mean number of friends their own friends have is affected by the exact arrangement fo friendships in a social network. This disproportionate experiencing of friends with many friends is related to a set of abstractly similar "class size paradoxes" that includes such diverse phenomena as the tendencies for college students to experience the mean class size as larger than it actually is and for people to experience beaches and parks as more crowded than they usually are.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model is developed to provide a theoretical framework for a computer-oriented solution to the problem of recognizing those records in two files which represent identical persons, objects or events (said to be matched). A comparison is to be made between the recorded characteristics and values in two records (one from each file) and a decision made as to whether or not the members of the comparison-pair represent the same person or event, or whether there is insufficient evidence to justify either of these decisions at stipulated levels of error. These three decisions are referred to as link (A 1), a non-link (A 3), and a possible link (A 2). The first two decisions are called positive dispositions. The two types of error are defined as the error of the decision A 1 when the members of the comparison pair are in fact unmatched, and the error of the decision A 3 when the members of the comparison pair are, in fact matched. The probabilities of these errors are defined as and respectively where u({$\gamma$}), m({$\gamma$}) are the probabilities of realizing {$\gamma$} (a comparison vector whose components are the coded agreements and disagreements on each characteristic) for unmatched and matched record pairs respectively. The summation is over the whole comparison space r of possible realizations. A linkage rule assigns probabilities P(A 1{\textbar}{$\gamma$}), and P(A 2{\textbar}{$\gamma$}), and P(A 3{\textbar}{$\gamma$}) to each possible realization of {$\gamma$} {$\varepsilon$} {$\Gamma$}. An optimal linkage rule L ({$\mu$}, {$\lambda$}, {$\Gamma$}) is defined for each value of ({$\mu$}, {$\lambda$}) as the rule that minimizes P(A 2) at those error levels. In other words, for fixed levels of error, the rule minimizes the probability of failing to make positive dispositions. A theorem describing the construction and properties of the optimal linkage rule and two corollaries to the theorem which make it a practical working tool are given.}

Observers overestimate the social interactions among kin and are 33.38 percentage points (J) more accurate in judgements of ties between non-kin (95\% confidence interval: 31.27--35.49). Counterintuitively, observers had more accurate beliefs about non-kin pairs, especially when the observers were popular, middle-aged, or educated. Observers were less able to accurately judge ties across different religions or wealth. Individuals in villages that cultivate coffee, requiring coordinated effort, demonstrated greater bias to view networks as connected. Finally, more accurate respondents had better access to information that we experimentally introduced to their peers. Overall, people inflate the number of connections in their networks and exhibit varying accuracy and bias, with implications for how people affect and are affected by the social world.

Sample prevalence estimates of cocaine use based on toxicologic results were nearly five times the survey-based estimates of past month use and nearly four times the survey-based estimates of past year use. With the hair test results as the standard, cocaine and heroin use were considerably underreported in the survey. Underreporting was more of a problem for cocaine than for heroin. Among those who tested positive, survey disclosure of cocaine use was associated with higher levels of cocaine detected in hair. In general, when recent drug use was reported, it was usually detected in hair. When a drug was detected in hair, use was usually not reported in the survey. When heroin was detected in hair, cocaine was almost always detected as well. Am J Epidemiol 1999; 149:955--62.}

  abstract = {Summary.{\enspace} Various bootstraps have been proposed for bootstrapping clustered data from one-way arrays. The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

Analysis of birth cohorts across the life-span since 1751 in Sweden reveals strong associations between early-age mortality and subsequent mortality in the same cohorts. We propose that a "cohort morbidity phenotype" represents inflammatory processes that persist from early age into adult life.}

However, it remains unclear how real-world social networks could influence the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches. To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a real-world social network generated from high-resolution GPS data that were gathered in the course of a citizen-science experiment3,4. We found that tracing the contacts of contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only contacts, but this strategy also resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals from quarantine led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting that contact tracing and quarantine might be most effective as a `local lockdown' strategy when contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals. Our findings suggest that targeted tracing and quarantine strategies would be most efficient when combined with other control measures such as physical distancing.},

  abstract = {McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears (2006, 2008b) reported that Americans' social networks shrank precipitously from 1985 to 2004. When asked to list the people with whom they discussed ``important matters,'' respondents to the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS) provided about one-third fewer names than did respondents in the 1985 survey. Critically, the percentage of respondents who provided no names at all increased from about 10 percent in 1985 to about 25 percent in 2004. The 2004 results contradict other relevant data, however, and they contain serious anomalies; this suggests that the apparently dramatic increase in social isolation is an artifact. One possible source of the artifact is the section of the 2004 interview preceding the network question; it may have been unusually taxing. Another possible source is a random technical error. With as yet no clear account for these inconsistencies and anomalies, scholars should be cautious in using the 2004 network data. Scholars and general readers alike should draw no inference from the 2004 GSS as to whether Americans' social networks changed substantially between 1985 and 2004; they probably did not.},

In a cross-sectional survey of 1050 adults living in northern California in 1977, we obtained the names and descriptions of 19417 associates. Of these, 59\% were labelled `friends'. Several regression analyses suggest that this label is likely to be applied: to an overwhelming majority of non-relatives in a largely unsystematic way; to associates lacking other, specialized role-relations; to people of the same age: to people known a long time; and to people with whom respondents had primarily sociable, rather than intimate or material, involvements.}

  abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is an increasingly popular chain-referral sampling method. Although it has proved effective at generating samples of hard to reach populations---meaning populations for which sampling frames are not available because they are hidden or socially stigmatized like sex workers or injecting drug users---quickly and cost-effectively, the ease of collecting the sample comes with a cost: bias or inefficiency in the estimates of population parameters (Gile \& Handcock, 2010; Goel \& Salganik, 2010). One way that RDS can produce inefficient estimates is if one or more of the recruitment chains gets stuck among members of a cohesive subpopulation, preventing the RDS sampling process from exploring other areas of the network. If that happens, members of the population subgroup recruit one another repeatedly, leading to an increase in sample size without increasing the diversity of the sample. This type of stickiness is particularly likely when hidden populations are stratified, and the stratified groups are organized into venues that provide opportunities to recruit other members of the same stratum. Female sex workers (FSW) in China, who are stratified into tiers of sex work that are correlated with marital status, age, and risk behaviors, are a prime example (Merli et al., 2014; Yamanis et al., 2013). Chinese FSW recruit clients from venues such as karaoke bars, massage parlors, or street corners. At larger venues, sex workers who participate in an RDS study might recruit other members of the same venue into the study at a higher rate than expected, leading to inefficient estimates. In short, the chain could get stuck in a venue.},

Using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, which was conducted from 1988 to 1994, we examined the associations between the frequencies of organizational and individual relationships (derived from factor analysis) and cigarette smoking, not having had a blood pressure check during the preceding 12 months, not having had a cholesterol check, not engaging in physical activity, and eating fruits and vegetables fewer than five times per day among men and women aged 18 years and older. Results. After adjusting for age, sex, race, educational attainment, marital status, and employment status, increases in organizational relationships were associated with decreases in all five behaviors: significant inverse linear trends were noted only for smoking and physical activity. For individual relationships, significant inverse linear trends were noted for not having a blood pressure check within the previous 12 months, not having had a cholesterol check, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. For physical inactivity, the shape of the relationship approximated a threshold response. For smoking, a significant positive linear trend was present. Conclusions. These results support findings from previous studies and indicate that social relationships have a beneficial effect on several behaviors that directly or indirectly affect the risk of cardiovascular disease.},

In particular, the cosponsorship network is much denser than other networks and aggregate features of the network appear to be influenced by institutional arrangements and strategic incentives.

  abstract = {Information bias is common in epidemiology and can substantially diminish the validity of study results. Validation studies, in which an investigator compares the accuracy of a measure with a gold standard measure, are an important way to understand and mitigate this bias. More attention is being paid to the importance of validation studies in recent years, yet they remain rare in epidemiologic research and, in our experience, they remain poorly understood. Many epidemiologists have not had any experience with validations studies, either in the classroom or in their work. We present an example of misclassification of a dichotomous exposure to elucidate some important misunderstandings about how to conduct validation studies to generate valid information. We demonstrate that careful attention to the design of validation studies is central to determining how the bias parameters (e.g. sensitivity and specificity or positive and negative predictive values) can be used in quantitative bias analyses to appropriately correct for misclassification. Whether sampling is done based on the true gold standard measure, the misclassified measure or at random will determine which parameters are valid and the precision of those estimates. Whether or not the validation is done stratified by other key variables (e.g. by the exposure) will also determine the validity of those estimates. We also present sample questions that can be used to teach these concepts. Increasing the presence of validation studies in the classroom could have a positive impact on their use and improve the validity of estimates of effect in epidemiologic research.}

Our findings suggest that relatively darker-skinned Latino immigrants experience skin-color-based discrimination in the realm of annual income. Furthermore, Latinos who are most integrated into the United States are the most likely to opt out of the existing U.S. racial categorization scheme.

First, we discuss assertions of the relevance of the human evolutionary past for understanding the character of human nature, for which evolutionary psychology currently receives the most attention. Second, we consider the work of behavioral genetics and the assertion of the relevance of genetic differences between persons for understanding differences in behaviors and outcomes. Third, we consider assertions of the relevance of particular proximate bioindicators for understanding how the biological and social interact, focusing particularly on studies of testosterone and the prospects of developments in neuroscientific measurement. We do not believe that developments in these fields will force sociologists to acquire considerable biological expertise to pursue questions central to the discipline, but we do advocate further efforts from biologically minded sociologists to articulate understandings of the relationship between sociology and biology that will continue to push us past the commonplace view that biological and sociological explanations are inevitably opposed.},

  abstract = {While some dismiss sociobiological theories as untestable, post hoc explanations, this article argues that sociologists should instead increase their efforts to identify and engage those theories that have novel empirical implications. Regarding parental investment, Triv-ers and Willard use Darwinian reasoning to hypothesize that high-status parents favor sons over daughters and that low-status parents favor daughters over sons. The application of this hypothesis to contemporary societies has been widely accepted by sociobiolo-gists, although it has received little actual empirical scrutiny. The Trivers-Willard hypothesis is tested in this study using two nationally representative surveys of American adolescents and their parents. Across several different measures of investment, little evidence of the predicted parental investment behaviors is found. This article seeks not only to contribute to settling the empirical point at issue but also to encourage a renewed and empirically focused dialogue between sociologists and sociobiologists.},

  abstract = {Although data on the prevalence of injection drug use are an essential prerequisite for estimating the number of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there have been few attempts to utilize statistical methods of population estimation based on multiple data sources. Data on 3,670 cases (2,866 individuals) were obtained from the HIV test register, drug treatment agencies, police records, and needle and syringe exchanges in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1990. Log-linear analysis was used to model the number of individuals in each of the sources. The model incorporating dependency among the three health care agencies (HIV test, drug treatment, and needle exchange) and independence of the police sample fitted the data well, with a residual chi 2 value of 2.9 (6 df). The expected value of the missing cell corresponding to absence from all four samples was 5,628, yielding an overall estimate of 8,494 injectors (95\% confidence interval (CI) 7,491-9,721), for a prevalence rate of 1.35\% for people aged 15-55 years in Glasgow during 1990. The high ratio of known to unknown injectors (1:2) resulted from the extensive coverage of known injectors and the relatively high level of overlap between the combined health care agency sample and the police sample. While further analysis demonstrated that the probability of appearing in the four samples varied by age and sex, heterogeneity in the population did not affect the choice of model or substantially alter the estimates for the total number of unknown injectors. A concurrent study of a community-wide sample of 503 injectors resulted in an HIV prevalence rate of 1.1\% (95\% CI 0.4-2.5\%). The results of these studies were combined to produce a further estimate of 93 HIV-infected current injectors in Glasgow (95\% CI 33-214).},

High quality observational data on contact patterns, usually presented in the form of age-specific contact matrices, are difficult to gather and are currently available only for few countries worldwide. Here we propose a computational approach, based on the simulation of a virtual society of agents, allowing the estimation of contact patterns by age for 26 European countries. We validate the estimated contact matrices against those obtained by the most extensive field study on contact patterns, with data collected in eight European countries. We show that our contact matrices share some common features, e.g. individuals tend to mix preferentially with individuals their own age, and country-specific differences, which can be partly explained by differences in population structures due to different demographic trajectories followed after WWII. Our analysis highlights well defined correlations between epidemiological parameters and socio-demographic features of the populations. This study provides the first estimates of contact matrices for many European countries where specific experimental data are still not available.}

While behavioural responses to the spread of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics. Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases are an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects, not least because the spread of a disease among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study. Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models can be broadly classified according to the type and source of information which individuals are assumed to base their behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in our understanding of the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these gaps.},

One critical question relates to the role of health as a mechanism driving these inequalities. This study explores the associations of self-rated health (SRH) and limitations in everyday activities with voting over the course of adulthood in the 1958 National Child Development Study and the 1970 British Cohort Study. We used data from participants who reported voting in the last general election at least once between the ages of 23 and 55 in the 1958 cohort and between the ages of 30 and 42 in the 1970 cohort. We examined associations controlling for a range of early-life and adult circumstances using random-effects models. Compared with those in good or better health: those in fair health had 15\% and 18\% lower odds of voting in the 1958 and 1970 cohorts; those in poor or worse health had 17\% and 32\% lower odds of voting in the 1958 and 1970 cohorts. These effects varied with age and were most marked among those in poor health at the ages of 23/30 in the 1958 and 1970 cohorts. Controlling for SRH, having limitations in everyday activities was not associated with voting in main models. Examining age-based differences, however, we found that reporting limitations was associated with a higher probability of voting at the age of 55 in the 1958 cohort and at the age of 30 in the 1970 cohort. Building on the qualities of the British birth cohorts, we offer nuanced evidence about the role of health on voting, which involves considerable life-course processes. Future studies need to examine how these findings progress after the age of 55, extend to mental wellbeing and health practices, and contribute to explain social inequalities in voter turnout.},

  abstract = {Biostatistics channels ecologists into thinking primarily about the mean and variance of a probability distribution. But many problems of biological interest concern the extremes in a variable (e.g., highest temperature, largest force, longest drought, maximum lifespan) rather than its central tendency. Such extremes are not adequately addressed by standard biostatistics. In these cases an alternative approach--the statistics of extremes--can be of value. In the limit of a large number of measurements, the probability structure of extreme values conforms to a generalized distribution described by three parameters. In practice these parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Using this estimate of the probability distribution of extreme values, one can predict the expected time between the imposition of extremes of a given magnitude (a return time) and can place confidence limits on this prediction. Using data regarding sea-surface temperature, wave-induced hydrodynamic forces, wind speeds, and human life-spans we show that accurate long-term predictions can at times be made from a surprisingly small number of measurements if appropriate care is taken in the application of the statistics. For example, accurate long-term prediction of sea-surface temperatures can be derived from short-term data that are anomalous in that they contain the effects of an extreme EL Nino. In the cases of wave-induced forces and wind speeds, the probability distribution of extreme values is similar among years and diverse sites, indicating the possible existence of unifying principles governing these phenomena. Limitations and possible misuse of the method are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} CAR is one of the poorest countries in the world. While UN statistics suggest that there is no health emergency in the country, two recently published mortality surveys contradict this. Moreover, recent accusations of massive scale human rights abuses by mercenaries suggested the need for a nationwide mortality survey. Methods{\enspace} Two stage cluster surveys were conducted in two different strata: one in the roughly half of the country within the Government's control, and one in the areas mostly outside of the Government's control. We randomly selected 40 clusters of 10 households in each stratum. The survey included questions on vital events with openended questions about health and household challenges at the beginning and end of each interview. Results{\enspace} 70 of 80 selected clusters were successfully visited. We interviewed 699 households, containing 5070 people. 11 households (1.6\%) refused to be interviewed and approximately 18.3\% of households were absent at the time of visitation, mainly in the safer Government controlled areas. Interviewed households had a birth rate of 42.6 /1000 / year (95\%CI 35.4--59.7) and a crude mortality rate (CMR) of 1.57 /10,000/day (95\%CI: 1.36--1.78). The birth rate was lower and the death rate markedly higher in the strata outside of Government control. Families described malaria or fever, and diarrhea as the primary reported causes of death with violence accounting for 6\% of all deaths. Conclusions{\enspace} CAR is experiencing a severe health emergency, with the highest measured nationwide mortality in the world to our knowledge. UN published death rate estimates appear to be less than one fourth of reality. There is a desperate need for food aid in the form of general distributions in CAR, along with the accompanying work programs, seed and tool distributions needed to restart local economies. This is of particular importance in rural areas outside of the Government control. While some humanitarian actors are doing their best to respond, the crisis level mortality rate suggests that the needs in CAR are being largely unmet.},

Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP), a model-based approach, is gaining traction against the traditional weighted approach for survey estimates. MRP estimates are susceptible to bias if there is an underlying structure that the methodology does not capture. This work aims to provide a new framework for specifying structured prior distributions that lead to bias reduction in MRP estimates. We use simulation studies to explore the benefit of these prior distributions and demonstrate their efficacy on non-representative US survey data. We show that structured prior distributions offer absolute bias reduction and variance reduction for posterior MRP estimates in a large variety of data regimes.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of inferring the opinions of a social network through strategically sampling a minimum subset of nodes by exploiting correlations in node opinions. We first introduce the concept of information dominating set (IDS). A subset of nodes in a given network is an IDS if knowing the opinions of nodes in this subset is sufficient to infer the opinion of the entire network. We focus on two fundamental algorithmic problems: (i) given a subset of the network, how to determine whether it is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a minimum IDS. Assuming binary opinions and the local majority rule for opinion correlation, we show that the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second problem is NP-hard in general networks. We then focus on networks with special structures, in particular, acyclic networks. We show that in acyclic networks, both problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection between the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. Our technique for establishing the hardness of the IDS problems is based on a novel graph transformation that transforms the IDS problems in a general network to that in an odd-degree network. This graph transformation technique not only gives an approximation algorithm to the IDS problems, but also provides a useful tool for general studies related to the local majority rule. Besides opinion sampling for applications such as political polling and market survey, the concept of IDS and the results obtained in this paper also find applications in data compression and identifying critical nodes in information networks.},

While the Web was envisioned as an equalizing force that allows everyone to access information, the digital divide prevents large amounts of people from being present online. Online social media, in particular, are prone to gender inequality, an important issue given the link between social media use and employment. Understanding gender inequality in social media is a challenging task due to the necessity of data sources that can provide large-scale measurements across multiple countries. Here, we show how the Facebook Gender Divide (FGD), a metric based on aggregated statistics of more than 1.4 billion users in 217 countries, explains various aspects of worldwide gender inequality. Our analysis shows that the FGD encodes gender equality indices in education, health, and economic opportunity. We find gender differences in network externalities that suggest that using social media has an added value for women. Furthermore, we find that low values of the FGD are associated with increases in economic gender equality. Our results suggest that online social networks, while suffering evident gender imbalance, may lower the barriers that women have to access to informational resources and help to narrow the economic gender gap.{$<$}/p{$>$}, {$<$}h3{$>$}Significance{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We present the Facebook Gender Divide, an inexpensive, real-time instrument for measuring gender differences in Facebook access and activity in 217 countries.

  abstract = {Background: Sentinel surveillance among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics (ANCs) has been the main source of information on HIV trends in sub-Saharan Africa. These data have also been used to generate national HIV and AIDS estimates. New technologies and resources have allowed many countries to conduct national population based surveys that include HIV prevalence measurement, as an additional source of information on the AIDS epidemic. Methods: The authors reviewed the reports of 20 national population based surveys from 19 countries carried out in sub-Saharan Africa since 2001. They examined the sampling methodology, HIV testing and response rates, and female:male and urban:rural prevalence ratios. They also constructed adjusted prevalence scenarios assuming different relative risks for survey non-responders. Results: The national population based surveys vary considerably in quality, as reflected in the household response rate (ranging from 75.4\% to 99.7\%), women's testing rate (ranging from 68.2\% to 97.3\%), and men's testing rate (ranging from 62.2\% to 95.4\%), while for some surveys detailed response information is lacking. While 95\% confidence intervals around the female:male and urban:rural prevalence ratios in individual countries are large, the median female:male ratio of the combined set of surveys results is 1.5 and the median urban:rural ratio 1.7. A scenario assuming that non-responders have twice the HIV prevalence of those who fully participated in the survey suggests that individual non-response could result in an adjusted HIV prevalence 1.03 to 1.34 times higher than the observed prevalence. Conclusions: Population based surveys can provide useful information on HIV prevalence levels and distribution. This information is being used to improve national HIV and AIDS estimates. Further refinements in data collection, analysis, and reporting, combined with high participation rates, can further improve HIV and AIDS estimates at national and regional level.},

Despite growing evidence of the size of the problem, current evidence comes largely from industrialised settings, and methodological differences limit the extent to which comparisons can be made between studies. We aimed to estimate the extent of physical and sexual intimate partner violence against women in 15 sites in ten countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia and Montenegro, Thailand, and the United Republic of Tanzania. Standardised population-based household surveys were done between 2000 and 2003. Women aged 15--49 years were interviewed and those who had ever had a male partner were asked in private about their experiences of physically and sexually violent and emotionally abusive acts. 24 097 women completed interviews, with around 1500 interviews per site. The reported lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual partner violence, or both, varied from 15\% to 71\%, with two sites having a prevalence of less than 25\%, seven between 25\% and 50\%, and six between 50\% and 75\%. Between 4\% and 54\% of respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence, or both, in the past year. Men who were more controlling were more likely to be violent against their partners. In all but one setting women were at far greater risk of physical or sexual violence by a partner than from violence by other people. The findings confirm that physical and sexual partner violence against women is widespread. The variation in prevalence within and between settings highlights that this violence in not inevitable, and must be addressed.}

The results strongly support the use of casualty connection data for understanding individuals' responses to international violence, and encourage future applications of social network approaches to the study of war and politics.},

Attention is given to how pre-pandemic racial/ethnic network disparities are exacerbated during the current crisis, with implications for physical and mental health outcomes.Evidence from the literature shows a robust association between strong social networks and physical and mental health outcomes. During times of crisis, access to social networks for older adults is disrupted, particularly for marginalized groups. We document pre-pandemic disparities in social networks resources and offer insight for examining the impact of COVID-19 on disrupting social networks among older adults.Importantly, racial/ethnic disparities in social networks both prior to and as a result of the pandemic intensify existing inequalities and demonstrate the necessity of better understanding social network inequalities for marginalized older adults, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis.}

  abstract = {Reliability theory is a general theory about systems failure. It allows researchers to predict the age-related failure kinetics for a system of given architecture (reliability structure) and given reliability of its components. Reliability theory predicts that even those systems that are entirely composed of non-aging elements (with a constant failure rate) will nevertheless deteriorate (fail more often) with age, if these systems are redundant in irreplaceable elements. Aging, therefore, is a direct consequence of systems redundancy. Reliability theory also predicts the late-life mortality deceleration with subsequent leveling-off, as well as the late-life mortality plateaus, as an inevitable consequence of redundancy exhaustion at extreme old ages. The theory explains why mortality rates increase exponentially with age (the Gompertz law) in many species, by taking into account the initial flaws (defects) in newly formed systems. It also explains why organisms ``prefer'' to die according to the Gompertz law, while technical devices usually fail according to the Weibull (power) law. Theoretical conditions are specified when organisms die according to the Weibull law: organisms should be relatively free of initial flaws and defects. The theory makes it possible to find a general failure law applicable to all adult and extreme old ages, where the Gompertz and the Weibull laws are just special cases of this more general failure law. The theory explains why relative differences in mortality rates of compared populations (within a given species) vanish with age, and mortality convergence is observed due to the exhaustion of initial differences in redundancy levels. Overall, reliability theory has an amazing predictive and explanatory power with a few, very general and realistic assumptions. Therefore, reliability theory seems to be a promising approach for developing a comprehensive theory of aging and longevity integrating mathematical methods with specific biological knowledge.}

  abstract = {A probability sample of households frequently must be translated into a sample of persons representing characteristics of the adult population. Researchers have developed at least 14 within-household respondent selection procedures or their variants to accomplish this task. Although probability methods are preferable, they often increase nonresponse. Quasi-probability and nonprobability techniques have been devised to increase cooperation and decrease costs, although they sacrifice the advantages of randomness. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the results of 16 studies that have compared within-household respondent selection procedures, with respect to demographic representativeness, cooperation or response rates, and costs. Although there is an increasing need to hold down costs yet maintain quality and accuracy as response rates are falling, little systematic, accessible evidence exists to guide choice of respondent selection method.}

It is then a challenge to develop general families of multilevel probability models that yield reasonable Bayesian inferences.

Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that broadband access has long depended on customers' position in the voice telecommunication infrastructure that was designed in the 1930s. The actual speed of an Internet connection, in fact, rapidly decays with the distance of the dwelling from the specific node of the network serving its area. Merging unique information about the topology of the voice network with geocoded longitudinal data about individual social capital, we show that access to broadband Internet caused a significant decline in forms of offline interaction and civic engagement. Overall, our results suggest that broadband penetration substantially crowded out several aspects of social capital.},

Analysis of these data reveals that, contrary to previous literature, the world population is unlikely to stop growing this century. There is an 80\% probability that world population, now 7.2 billion people, will increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100. This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional UN high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline. Also, the ratio of working-age people to older people is likely to decline substantially in all countries, even those that currently have young populations. Global population growth continuing The United Nations released new population projections for all countries in July 2014. Gerland et al. analyzed the data and describe the probabilistic population projections for the entire world as well as individual regions and countries (see the Perspective by Smeeding). World population is likely to continue growing for the rest of the century, with at least a 3.5-fold increase in the population of Africa. Furthermore, the ratio of working-age people to older people is almost certain to decline substantially in all countries, not just currently developed ones.

Though MRP is an increasingly popular method, we improve upon it in numerous ways: deeper levels of covariate interaction, allowing for nonlinearity and nonmonotonicity, accounting for unequal inclusion probabilities that are conveyed in survey weights, postestimation adjustments to turnout and voting levels, and informative multidimensional graphical displays as a form of model checking. We use a series of examples to demonstrate the flexibility of our method, including an illustration of turnout and vote choice as subgroups become increasingly detailed, and an analysis of both vote choice changes and turnout changes from 2004 to 2008.},

Further, dyadic encounters require that two people be simultaneously available to interact, creating the need for coordinated scheduling. Here I study the consequences of scheduling for network diffusion, using a computer simulation that interposes a scheduling process between a pre-existing network and instances of contagion. The pace and extent of diffusion are shown to depend upon the interaction of network topology, contagion rule (on first-contact versus at some threshold), and whether actors try to remedy past scheduling imperfections. Scheduling turns central actors into diffusion bottlenecks, but can also trigger early adoption by giving actors false readings on the status of their network alters. The implications of scheduling extend beyond diffusion, to other outcomes such as decision-making, as well as to network evolution.},

As an alternative, we introduce a model-assisted approach, resulting in a design-based estimator leveraging a working network model. We derive a new class of estimators for population means and a corresponding bootstrap standard error estimator. We demonstrate improved performance compared with existing estimators, including adjustment for an initial convenience sample. We also apply the method and an extension to the estimation of the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in a high-risk population.},

The first explicitly models pathogen mutation and individual memory immune responses, with contacted individuals becoming infected only if they are exposed to strains that are significantly different from other strains in their memory repertoire. The second model is a reduction of the first to a system of difference equations. In this case, individuals spend a fixed amount of time in a generalized immune class. In both models, we observe four fundamentally different types of behavior, depending on parameters: (1) pathogen extinction due to lack of contact between individuals; (2) endemic infection; (3) periodic epidemic outbreaks; and (4) one or more outbreaks followed by extinction of the epidemic due to extremely low minima in the oscillations. We analyze both models to determine the location of each transition. Our main result is that pathogens in highly connected populations must mutate rapidly in order to remain viable.}

Our goal in this paper is to obtain a representative (unbiased) sample of Facebook users by crawling its social graph. In this quest, we consider and implement several candidate techniques. Two approaches that are found to perform well are the Metropolis-Hasting random walk (MHRW) and a re-weighted random walk (RWRW). Both have pros and cons, which we demonstrate through a comparison to each other as well as to the "ground-truth" (UNI - obtained through true uniform sampling of FB userIDs). In contrast, the traditional Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and Random Walk (RW) perform quite poorly, producing substantially biased results. In addition to offline performance assessment, we introduce online formal convergence diagnostics to assess sample quality during the data collection process. We show how these can be used to effectively determine when a random walk sample is of adequate size and quality for subsequent use (i.e., when it is safe to cease sampling). Using these methods, we collect the first, to the best of our knowledge, unbiased sample of Facebook. Finally, we use one of our representative datasets, collected through MHRW, to characterize several key properties of Facebook.},

Individual social capital should then be aggregated to measure the social capital of a community.  This paper assembles the evidence that supports the individual-based model of social capital formation, including seven facts: (1) the relationship between social capital and age is first increasing and then decreasing, (2) social capital declines with expected mobility, (3) social capital investment is higher in occupations with greater returns to social skills, (4) social capital is higher among homeowners, (5) social connections fall sharply with physical distance, (6) people who invest in human capital also invest in social capital, and (7) social capital appears to have interpersonal complementarities.}

Trustworthiness declines when partners are of different races or nationalities. High status individuals are able to elicit more trustworthiness in others.}

RDS data are collected through a snowball mechanism, in which current sample members recruit future sample members. In this paper we present RDS as Markov chain Monte Carlo importance sampling, and we examine the effects of community structure and the recruitment procedure on the variance of RDS estimates. Past work has assumed that the variance of RDS estimates is primarily affected by segregation between healthy and infected individuals. We examine an illustrative model to show that this is not necessarily the case, and that bottlenecks anywhere in the networks can substantially affect estimates. We also show that variance is inflated by a common design feature in which the sample members are encouraged to recruit multiple future sample members. The paper concludes with suggestions for implementing and evaluating RDS studies. Copyright {\copyright} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Over their lifetimes, citizens tend to habituate voting and comply with a growing subjective norm of voting. Furthermore, the average voting participation of older people is influenced by their longer duration of residence, the lack of a mobilising partner, worse physical health and less education, although life experience replaces the function of formal education over a lifetime. Most of these factors are founded on the very nature of human behaviour and the social context of our life course. Thus, they arguably stand outside of the political process and will remain stable into the future.},

  abstract = {Summary. In dynamic models of infectious disease transmission, typically various mixing patterns are imposed on the so-called `who acquires infection from whom' matrix. These imposed mixing patterns are based on prior knowledge of age-related social mixing behaviour rather than observations. Alternatively, we can assume that transmission rates for infections transmitted predominantly through non-sexual social contacts are proportional to rates of conversational contact which can be estimated from a contact survey. In general, however, contacts reported in social contact surveys are proxies of those events by which transmission may occur and there may be age-specific characteristics that are related to susceptibility and infectiousness which are not captured by the contact rates. Therefore, we model transmission as the product of two age-specific variables: the age-specific contact rate and an age-specific proportionality factor, which entails an improvement of fit for the seroprevalence of the varicella zoster virus in Belgium. Furthermore, we address the effect on the estimation of the basic reproduction number, using non-parametric bootstrapping to account for different sources of variability and using multimodel inference to deal with model selection uncertainty. The method proposed makes it possible to obtain important information on transmission dynamics that cannot be inferred from approaches that have been traditionally applied hitherto.},

Birth rate was affected by both poverty and income inequality, though income inequality appeared to affect teen birth rate primarily through its impact on social capital.},

Existing methods select the single record having the maximum weight provided that this weight is higher than an assigned threshold. We argue that this procedure, which ignores all information from matches with lower weights and for some individuals assigns no match, is inefficient and may also lead to biases in subsequent analysis of the linked data. We propose that a multiple imputation framework be utilised for data that belong to records that cannot be matched unequivocally. In this way, the information from all potential matches is transferred through to the analysis stage. This procedure allows for the propagation of matching uncertainty through a full modelling process that preserves the data structure. For purposes of statistical modelling, results from a simulation example suggest that a full probabilistic record linkage is unnecessary and that standard multiple imputation will provide unbiased and efficient parameter estimates.

We study the method of generalized cross-validation (GCV) for choosing a good value {\^undefined} for {$\lambda$}, from the data. The estimate {\^undefined} is the minimizer of V({$\lambda$}) given by \$V({\textbackslash}lambda)={\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\}{\textbackslash}{\textbar}(I-A({\textbackslash}lambda))y{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}/{\textbackslash}left[{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\}{\textbackslash}text\{Trace\}(I-A({\textbackslash}lambda)){\textbackslash}right]{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ , where A({$\lambda$})=X(XTX+n{$\lambda$} I)-1XT. This estimate is a rotation-invariant version of Allen's PRESS, or ordinary cross-validation. This estimate behaves like a risk improvement estimator, but does not require an estimate of {$\sigma$} 2, so can be used when n - p is small, or even if p {$\geq$} n in certain cases. The GCV method can also be used in subset selection and singular value truncation methods for regression, and even to choose from among mixtures of these methods.},

In this paper we analyze a dataset of Twitter conversations collected across six months involving 1.7 million individuals and test the theoretical cognitive limit on the number of stable social relationships known as Dunbar's number. We find that the data are in agreement with Dunbar's result; users can entertain a maximum of 100--200 stable relationships. Thus, the `economy of attention' is limited in the online world by cognitive and biological constraints as predicted by Dunbar's theory. We propose a simple model for users' behavior that includes finite priority queuing and time resources that reproduces the observed social behavior.}

  abstract = {Objective: Patterns of transmission of HIV are different among different regions of the world and change over time within regions. In order to adapt prevention strategies to changing patterns of risk, we need to understand the behaviours that put people at risk of infection and how new infections are distributed among risk groups. Methods: A model is described to calculate the expected incidence of HIV infections in the adult population by mode of exposure using the current distribution of prevalent infections and the patterns of risk within different populations. For illustration the model is applied to Thailand and Kenya. Results: New infections in Kenya were mainly transmitted through heterosexual contact (90\%), while a small but significant number were related to injecting drug use (4.8\%) and men who have sex with men (4.5\%). In Thailand, the epidemic has spread over time to the sexual partners of vulnerable groups and in 2005 the majority of new infections occurred among the low risk heterosexual population (43\%). Men having sex with men accounted for 21\% and sex work (including sex workers, clients, and partners of clients) for 18\% of new infections. Medical interventions did not contribute significantly to new infections in either Kenya or Thailand. Conclusions: The model provides a simple tool to inform the planning of effective, appropriately targeted, country specific intervention programmes. However, better surveillance systems are needed in countries to obtain more reliable biological and behavioural data in order to improve the estimates of incidence by risk group.},

  abstract = {Models of collective behavior are developed for situations where actors have two alternatives and the costs and/or benefits of each depend on how many other actors choose which alternative. The key concept is that of "threshold": the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so; this is the point where net benefits begin to exceed net costs for that particular actor. Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or "equilibrium" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered. Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions distributions for outcomes. Groups with similar average preferences may generate very different results; hence it is hazardous to infer individual dispositions from aggregate outcomes or to assume that behavior was directed by ultimately agreed-upon norms. Suggested applications are to riot behavior, innovation and rumor diffusion, strikes, voting, and migration. Issues of measurement, falsification, and verification are discussed.}

  abstract = {Background Few studies have quantified social mixing in remote rural areas of developing countries, where the burden of infectious diseases is usually the highest. Understanding social mixing patterns in those settings is crucial to inform the implementation of strategies for disease prevention and control. We characterized contact and social mixing patterns in rural communities of the Peruvian highlands. Methods and Findings This cross-sectional study was nested in a large prospective household-based study of respiratory infections conducted in the province of San Marcos, Cajamarca-Peru. Members of study households were interviewed using a structured questionnaire of social contacts (conversation or physical interaction) experienced during the last 24 hours. We identified 9015 reported contacts from 588 study household members. The median age of respondents was 17 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4--34 years). The median number of reported contacts was 12 (IQR 8--20) whereas the median number of physical (i.e. skin-to-skin) contacts was 8.5 (IQR 5--14). Study participants had contacts mostly with people of similar age, and with their offspring or parents. The number of reported contacts was mainly determined by the participants' age, household size and occupation. School-aged children had more contacts than other age groups. Within-household reciprocity of contacts reporting declined with household size (range 70\%-100\%). Ninety percent of household contact networks were complete, and furthermore, household members' contacts with non-household members showed significant overlap (range 33\%-86\%), indicating a high degree of contact clustering. A two-level mixing epidemic model was simulated to compare within-household mixing based on observed contact networks and within-household random mixing. No differences in the size or duration of the simulated epidemics were revealed. Conclusion This study of rural low-density communities in the highlands of Peru suggests contact patterns are highly assortative. Study findings support the use of within-household homogenous mixing assumptions for epidemic modeling in this setting.},

Grinberg et al. analyzed Twitter data by matching Twitter accounts to specific voters to determine who was exposed to fake news, who spread fake news, and how fake news interacted with factual news (see the Perspective by Ruths). Fake news accounted for nearly 6\% of all news consumption, but it was heavily concentrated---only 1\% of users were exposed to 80\% of fake news, and 0.1\% of users were responsible for sharing 80\% of fake news. Interestingly, fake news was most concentrated among conservative voters. Science, this issue p. 374; see also p. 348 The spread of fake news on social media became a public concern in the United States after the 2016 presidential election. We examined exposure to and sharing of fake news by registered voters on Twitter and found that engagement with fake news sources was extremely concentrated. Only 1\% of individuals accounted for 80\% of fake news source exposures, and 0.1\% accounted for nearly 80\% of fake news sources shared. Individuals most likely to engage with fake news sources were conservative leaning, older, and highly engaged with political news. A cluster of fake news sources shared overlapping audiences on the extreme right, but for people across the political spectrum, most political news exposure still came from mainstream media outlets. A small proportion of voters share and are exposed to the majority of online fake news. A small proportion of voters share and are exposed to the majority of online fake news.},

Given the potential for widespread dissemination of this material, we examine the individual-level characteristics associated with sharing false articles during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. To do so, we uniquely link an original survey with respondents' sharing activity as recorded in Facebook profile data. First and foremost, we find that sharing this content was a relatively rare activity. Conservatives were more likely to share articles from fake news domains, which in 2016 were largely pro-Trump in orientation, than liberals or moderates. We also find a strong age effect, which persists after controlling for partisanship and ideology: On average, users over 65 shared nearly seven times as many articles from fake news domains as the youngest age group. Fake news sharing in 2016 was rare but significantly more common among older Americans. Fake news sharing in 2016 was rare but significantly more common among older Americans.},

  abstract = {Background: E-cigarettes have rapidly increased in popularity in recent years, driven, at least in part, by marketing and word-of-mouth discussion on Twitter. Given the rapid proliferation of e-cigarettes, researchers need timely quantitative data from e-cigarette users and smokers who may see e-cigarettes as a cessation tool. Twitter provides an ideal platform for recruiting e-cigarette users and smokers who use Twitter. Online panels offer a second method of accessing this population, but they have been criticized for recruiting too few young adults, among whom e-cigarette use rates are highest. Objective: This study compares effectiveness of recruiting Twitter users who are e-cigarette users and smokers who have never used e-cigarettes via Twitter to online panelists provided by Qualtrics and explores how users recruited differ by demographics, e-cigarette use, and social media use. Methods: Participants were adults who had ever used e-cigarettes (n=278; male: 57.6\%, 160/278; age: mean 34.26, SD 14.16 years) and smokers (n=102; male: 38.2\%, 39/102; age: mean 42.80, SD 14.16 years) with public Twitter profiles. Participants were recruited via online panel (n=190) or promoted tweets using keyword targeting for e-cigarette users (n=190). Predictor variables were demographics (age, gender, education, race/ethnicity), e-cigarette use (eg, past 30-day e-cigarette use, e-cigarette puffs per day), social media use behaviors (eg, Twitter use frequency), and days to final survey completion from survey launch for Twitter versus panel. Recruitment method (Twitter, panel) was the dependent variable. Results: Across the total sample, participants were recruited more quickly via Twitter (incidence rate ratio=1.30, P=.02) than panel. Compared with young adult e-cigarette users (age 18-24 years), e-cigarette users aged 25 to 34 years (OR 0.01, 95\% CI 0.00-0.60, P=.03) and 35 to 44 years (OR 0.01, 95\% CI 0.00-0.51, P=.02) were more likely to be recruited via Twitter than panel. Smokers aged 35 to 44 years were less likely than those aged 18 to 24 years to be recruited via Twitter than panel (35-44: OR 0.03, 95\% CI 0.00-0.49, P=.01). E-cigarette users who reported a greater number of e-cigarette puffs per day were more likely to be recruited via Twitter than panel compared to those who reported fewer puffs per day (OR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.05-1.20, P=.001). With each one-unit increase in Twitter usage, e-cigarette users were 9.55 times (95\% CI 2.28-40.00, P=.002) and smokers were 4.91 times (95\% CI 1.90-12.74, P=.001) as likely to be recruited via Twitter than panel. Conclusions: Twitter ads were more time efficient than an online panel in recruiting e-cigarette users and smokers. In addition, Twitter provided access to younger adults, who were heavier users of e-cigarettes and Twitter. Recruiting via social media and online panel in combination offered access to a more diverse population of participants.  [J Med Internet Res 2016;18(11):e288]},

Skin tone differentials in socioeconomic status reflect both the inherited privileges ofa mulatto elite and contemporary preferences for lighter skin. Three influential studies have claimed that such differentials in educational, occupational and spousal attainment have remained strong in the post-Civil Rights era, based on results from large nationally representative surveys. However, these studies used a period conception of change which ignored the potential for changes across cohorts within the same period. I re-analyze the available data and find significant declines in skin tone differentials for younger cohorts, in terms of educational and labor market outcomes, but not in terms of spousal attainment. These declines begin with cohorts born in the mid-1940s. In addition, there is evidence of period declines of skin tone differentials in occupational attainment in the 1980s. I discuss possible explanations for the declines.},

Participants aged between 18 and 60 years were recruited. The average social network size (c) was estimated and adjusted by known population method. The size of HIV KAP in Chongqing municipality was estimated using the adjusted c value with adjustment for the transmission effect using the scaled respect factor.Results3,026 inhabitants of Chongqing agreed to the survey, and 2,957 (97.7\%) completed the questionnaire. The adjusted c value was 310. The estimated size of KAP was 28,418(95\% Confidence Interval (CI):26,636{$\sim$}30,201) for female sex workers (FSW), 163,199(95\%CI:156,490{$\sim$}169,908) for clients of FSW, 37,959(95\%CI: 34,888{$\sim$}41,030) for drug users (DU), 14,975(95\%CI:13,047{$\sim$}16,904) for injecting drug users (IDU) and 16,767(95\%CI:14,602{$\sim$}18,932) for men who have sex with men (MSM). The ratio of clients to FSW was 5.74{$:$}1, and IDU accounted for 39.5\% of the DU population. The estimates suggest that FSW account for 0.37\% of the female population aged 15--49 years in Chongqing, and clients of FSW and MSM represent 2.09\% and 0.21\% of the male population aged 15--49 years in the city, respectively.ConclusionNSUM provides reasonable population size estimates for FSW, their clients, DU and IDU in Chongqing. However, it is likely to underestimate the population size of MSM even after adjusting for the transmission effect.}

  abstract = {Background India has experienced the second largest outbreak of COVID-19 globally, yet there is a paucity of studies analysing contact tracing data in the region which can optimise public health interventions (PHI's). Methods We analysed contact tracing data from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We studied determinants of risk of further transmission and risk of being symptomatic using Poisson regression models. Findings Up to 21 July 2020, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of {$\geq$}8 secondary cases. Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7\% of index cases had 14.4\% of contacts but caused 80\% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6\% [95\% CI, 3.4--3.9] and symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7\% vs 2.0\%; aRR 3.63 [3.04--4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19--44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07--0.66] for 0--5 years and 0.47 [0.32--0.68] for 6--18 years). Infectors who were confirmed {$\geq$}4 days after symptom onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11--4.31]). As compared to asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases were 8.16 [3.29--20.24] times more likely to cause symptomatic infection in their secondary cases. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 [4.4--6.4] days, and case fatality rate was 2.5\% [2.4--2.7] which increased with age. Conclusion We found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised and retrospective contact tracing should be implemented. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented. Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. We propose that symptomatic cases could cause a snowballing effect on clinical severity and infectiousness across transmission generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding.},

We provide direct estimates of social differences in life expectancy in India using survey data spanning two decades. We show that individuals from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have drastically and persistently lower life expectancies than high-caste individuals (between 4.2--4.4 years for women and 6.1--7.0 years for men in 2013--2016). While Muslims had a modest life expectancy disadvantage compared to high castes in 1997--2000, this disadvantage has grown substantially over the past 20 years. Mortality disparities between marginalized and privileged social groups are present across the entire life-course and are increasingly driven by older-age mortality. Our findings reveal a pressing need for far greater attention to the health of marginalized populations in India.},

  abstract = {By early April 2020, the U.S. experienced more confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other country. Governments, businesses, and individuals have made extraordinary changes in how they function in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. In this paper, we analyze near-real-time data related to policy responses, information shocks, and mobility patterns that serve as proxies for social distancing. We also conduct a preliminary study of population health outcomes that capture the magnitude and severity of the epidemic, and how. We make two main contributions toward understanding the effects of policies related to the epidemic. First, we develop a typology to organize and group heterogeneous state and local government responses to the epidemic, and assess how those responses have affected social distancing measures in the early stages of the epidemic. Although social distancing has emerged as a major policy goal, very little is known about which policy approaches are effective at producing social distance, or about the importance of social changes relative to nationwide awareness of the epidemic or to state and local information on the progression of the epidemic. We harness several sources of commercial ``smart-device'' data on mobility and illness patterns and estimate event study regressions to disentangle responses to information from responses to mandates. Second, we use data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and mortality to assess the degree to which governments' adoption of policies appear to correlate with anticipated growth in the epidemic at a local level. We estimate simple event study models of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and we also discuss some ways that difference-in-difference and event study models may be interpreted through the lens of a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) theoretical model. Using multiple proxy outcome measures, we find large declines in mobility in all states since the start of the epidemic. Even states that did not implement major policy changes have experienced large mobility declines, and other states experienced large changes before the policy actions. This suggests that a substantial portion of the response to the epidemic was not induced by specific government policies. However, our event study analysis implies that policy changes and informational events have also led to independent decreases in mobility. We find that five days after a state or county policy change or informational event, there are mobility reductions that are mostly in the range of one to below five percent, and mostly in the range of 2-8\% for 20 days out, with county policies associated with larger effect sizes than state policies. Our analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths suggest that state government action often immediately precedes substantial increases in caseloads and deaths. This is logical given efforts to model the direction of the epidemic, but it suggests methodological challenges in estimating the effects of policy changes on the COVID-19 related health outcomes. Overall, our results suggest that state and local government policy and informational events induced changes in mobility on top of what appears to be a much larger response across all states to the prevailing knowledge and events at both national and international levels. These results shed light on the likely consequences of proposals to lift various government mandates and the role of waning public support for social distancing, which could lead to a decline in the amount of voluntary reductions in mobility.}

This model is generalized by allowing for different transmission probabilities that may correspond to various levels of risk factors on both the household and community levels. Two types of models are considered: (i) models for household data, where the numbers of susceptible and infected members in each household are known along with the values of household level risk factors; and (ii) models for individual data, where the infection status and risk factor level are known for each individual in the household. Although the type (i) models can be expressed as special cases of the type (ii) models, they deserve special attention as they can be represented and analyzed as log-linear models. Both types of models can be analyzed using maximum likelihood methods, while the type (i) models, when expressed as log-linear models, can also be analyzed by the weighted least squares method. Data from influenza epidemics in Tecumseh, Michigan and Seattle, Washington are used to illustrate these methods.},

It also enables the production of vital statistics for local planning of social services. In many low- and lower-middle-income countries, however, civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems do not adequately register significant numbers of births and, especially, deaths. In this study, we aim to estimate the completeness of adult death registration (for age 15 and older) in the Matlab health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) area in Bangladesh and to identify reasons for (not) registering deaths in the national CRVS system. We conducted a sample survey of 2538 households and recorded 571 adult deaths that had occurred in the 3 years preceding the survey. Only 17\% of these deaths were registered in the national CRVS system, with large gender differences in registration rates (male = 26\% vs. female = 5\%). Respondents who reported that a recent death in the household was registered indicated that the primary reasons for registration were to secure an inheritance and to access social services. The main reasons cited for not registering a death were lack of knowledge about CRVS and not perceiving the benefits of death registration. Information campaigns to raise awareness of death registration, as well as stronger incentives to register deaths, may be needed to improve the completeness of death registration in Bangladesh.},

Methods Participants were 479 054 individuals from the UK Biobank. The exposures were self-reported social isolation and loneliness. AMI, stroke and mortality were the outcomes. Results Over 7.1 years, 5731 had first AMI, and 3471 had first stroke. In model adjusted for demographics, social isolation was associated with higher risk of AMI (HR 1.43, 95\% CI 1.3 to --1.55) and stroke (HR 1.39, 95\% CI 1.25 to 1.54). When adjusted for all the other risk factors, the HR for AMI was attenuated by 84\% to 1.07 (95\% CI 0.99 to 1.16) and the HR for stroke was attenuated by 83\% to 1.06 (95\% CI 0.96 to 1.19). Loneliness was associated with higher risk of AMI before (HR 1.49, 95\% CI 1.36 to 1.64) but attenuated considerably with adjustments (HR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.96 to 1.17). This was also the case for stroke (HR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.20 to 1.55 before and HR 1.04, 95\% CI 0.91 to 1.19 after adjustments). Social isolation, but not loneliness, was associated with increased mortality in participants with a history of AMI (HR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.51) or stroke (HR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.61) in the fully adjusted model. Conclusions Isolated and lonely persons are at increased risk of AMI and stroke, and, among those with a history of AMI or stroke, increased risk of death. Most of this risk was explained by conventional risk factors.},

Two different definitions of ``number of unknown parameters'' in AIC are considered. A careful description is given of the influence of density tail properties on performance of both types of AIC and on KLCV . A number of practical conclusions emerge. In particular, we find that AIC will often give problems when used with heavy-tailed unbounded densities, but can perform quite well with compactly supported densities. In the latter case, both types of AIC produce similar results, and those results will sometimes be asymptotically equivalent to the ones obtained from KLCV . However, depending on the shape of the true density, the KLCV method can fail to balance ``bias'' and ``variance'' components of loss, with the result that KLCV and AIC may produce very different results.},

The formula depends only on the data and the smoothing parameter, which is readily chosen according to the criterion of minimum stochastic complexity. Approaches based on stochastic complexity and description length are shown to be asymptotically equivalent in certain circumstances. They produce a degree of smoothing which is almost optimal from the viewpoint of minimizing L{$\infty$}, or supremum, distance, but which smooths a little more than is optimal in the sense of minimizing Lr distance for any finite value of r.},

  abstract = {Cognitive maps of social behavior are of interest for theoretical as well as methodological reasons. The issue that has primarily been addressed, in comparing cognitive with behavioral social network data, is whether the participants' level of accuracy in reporting their social behavior is high enough to warrant the use of cognitive data as a substitute for behavioral data. The present paper focuses, instead, on what these imperfectly matched sets of data may tell us about low level processes of cultural codification, namely, those revealed by the transformation of behavioral interaction to cognitive report. Specifically, the analyses undertaken here indicate that the discrepancies between the two kinds of data are systematic, and that the cognitive data reflect an integration of the participants' direct relationships with each other into the set of relationships they observe as well as participate in. Participants tend to discount their high-frequency co-interactants for whom they, in turn, are relatively low-frequency co-interactants, in favor of those with whom they are reciprocally high. Thus, in reporting their direct relationships, they are in effect codifying them in terms of indirect relationships - namely, the relationships their co-interactants have with others in the set.}

  abstract = {Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is n approach to sampling design and inference in hard-to-reach human populations. It is often used in situations where the target population is rare and/or stigmatized in the larger population, so that it is prohibitively expensive to contact them through the available frames. Common examples include injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers. Most analysis of RDS data has focused on estimating aggregate characteristics, such as disease prevalence. However, RDS is often conducted in settings where the population size is unknown and of great independent interest. This paper presents an approach to estimating the size of a target population based on data collected through RDS. The proposed approach uses a successive sampling approximation to RDS to leverage information in the ordered sequence of observed personal network sizes. The inference uses the Bayesian framework, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge. A flexible class of priors for the population size is used that aids elicitation. An extensive simulation study provides insight into the performance of the method for estimating population size under a broad range of conditions. A further study shows the approach also improves estimation of aggregate characteristics. Finally, the method demonstrates sensible results when used to estimate the size of known networked populations from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and when used to estimate the size of a hard-to-reach population at high risk for HIV.},

Could such a test be engineered to give easily computed p-values that are reliable in samples of moderate size, or would simulation be needed for reliable calibration? What new concerns are introduced by random assignment of clusters? Which tests of balance would be optimal? To address these questions, Fisher's randomization inference is applied to the question of balance.

The Matlab HDSS is maintained by icddr,b. The surveillance area is divided into two service areas -- 1) Government service area and 2) icddr,b service area. Usual government health and family planning services are available in the Government service area. The icddr,b service area is sub-divided into four blocks, where family planning, immunization and limited curative services are provided to children under two years of age and women of reproductive age with the collaboration of the Government Health and Family Planning department in addition to usual Government services.  In the surveillance area, the fertility rate in 2019 slightly increased compared to 2018 (21.1 vs 21.9). The total fertility rate (TFR) was 2.6 per woman in 2019 and 2.5 in 2018. YFR was 2.6 in both the service areas. The crude birth rate (CBR) was 21.9 per 1,000 populations in 2019 whereas in 2018 the rate was 21.0. In the icddr,b service area, CBR was 21.8 and in the Government service area CBR was 21.9.  The crude death rate (CDR) was 7.2 per 1,000 population in the icddr,b service area compared to 7.9 in Government service in 2019. The neonatal mortality rate significantly increased from 15.1 in 2018 to 18.9 in 2019 in the icddr,b service area whereas in Government service area it increased from 20.3 to 22.3 in same time period. The infant mortality rate was 25 per 1,000 live births in the icddr,b service area compared to 28.7 in the Government service area. Post-neonatal mortality increased in both icddr,b service area (from 3.7 to 6.2) and in the Government service area (from 4.0 to 6.4) respectively. Under five mortality rate also showed an increase from 27.7 in 2018 to 29.8 in 2019 for the icddr,b service area, and from 30.9 in 2018 to 38.6 in 2019 for Government service area. The annual rate of natural increase in population size was 14.3 per 1,000 in 2019.  The rate of in-migration decreased from 50.2 in 2018 to 46.0 in 2019 per 1,000 populations, and the rate of out-migration also decreased from 59.1 in 2018 to 52.8 in 2019. The overall annual population growth rate was 1.4\%. The marriage rate was 13.9 per 1,000 people, and the divorce rate was 1.8 per 1,000 people.},

To address these questions, we unpack the ``electoral connection'' by exploring the mass public's attitudes toward partisan conflict via two survey experiments in which we manipulated characteristics of members and Congress. We find that party conflict reduces confidence in Congress among citizens across the partisan spectrum. However, there exists heterogeneity by strength of party identification with respect to evaluations of members. Independents and weak partisans are more supportive of members who espouse a bipartisan image, whereas strong partisans are less supportive. People with strong attachments to a political party disavow conflict in the aggregate but approve of individual members behaving in a partisan manner. This pattern helps us understand why members in safely partisan districts engage in partisan conflict even though partisanship damages the collective reputation of the institution.},

Additionally, findings suggest that Internet know-how is not randomly distributed among the population, rather, higher levels of parental education, being a male, and being white or Asian American are associated with higher levels of Web-use skill. These user characteristics are also related to the extent to which young adults engage in diverse types of online activities. Moreover, skill itself is positively associated with types of uses. Overall, these findings suggest that even when controlling for basic Internet access, among a group of young adults, socioeconomic status is an important predictor of how people are incorporating the Web into their everyday lives with those from more privileged backgrounds using it in more informed ways for a larger number of activities.},

Finally it is discussed whether the relationships of healthy lifestyle habits to survival and health contribute to healthy ageing.Results:{\enspace} the unhealthy lifestyle habits smoking, having a low-quality diet, and being physically inactive were singly related to an increased mortality risk (hazard ratios ranged from 1.2 to 2.1). In addition, inactive and smoking persons had an increased risk for a decline in health status as compared with active and non-smoking people. The net effect of a healthy lifestyle on the process of healthy ageing is likely to go together with a compressed cumulative morbidity.Conclusions:{\enspace} a healthy lifestyle at older ages is positively related to a reduced mortality risk and to a delay in the deterioration in health status. This postponement of the onset of major morbidity is likely to go together with a compressed cumulative morbidity. Therefore, health promotion at older ages can contribute to healthy ageing.},

Even in hunting and gathering societies, where the mortality rate is high, adult life spans average twice those of chimpanzees, which become decrepit during their fertile years and rarely survive them. Since women usually remain healthy through and beyond childbearing age, human communities include substantial proportions of economically productive postmenopausal women. A grandmother hypothesis8--12 may explain why greater longevity evolved in our lineage while female fertility still ends at ancestral ages. This hypothesis has implications for the evolution of a wide array of human features. Here we review some history of the hypothesis, recent findings, and questions for ongoing research.},

Whereas early data from symptomatic case confirmations suggested a lack of disease in children, subsequent contact tracing studies have found that children are likely to be infected. Governments are now facing immense pressure to weigh the public health benefit of interventions such as school closure against the significant economic disruption they impose. To motivate the discussion of age-stratified social distancing measures, we discuss potential biological mechanisms by which a skewed age distribution of cases may be generated and show through mathematical modelling how different age-targeted interventions are likely to affect the epidemic final size. We propose that identifying age-dependent transmissibility, in addition to susceptibility, will be essential to understand which social distancing measures are likely to be the most impactful going forward.},

  abstract = {In surveys concerning sensitive behavior or attitudes, respondents often do not answer truthfully, because of social desirability bias. To elicit more honest responding, the randomized-response (RR) technique aims at increasing perceived and actual anonymity by prompting respondents to answer with a randomly modified and thus uninformative response. In the crosswise model, as a particularly promising variant of the RR, this is achieved by adding a second, nonsensitive question and by prompting respondents to answer both questions jointly. Despite increased privacy protection and empirically higher prevalence estimates of socially undesirable behaviors, evidence also suggests that some respondents might still not adhere to the instructions, in turn leading to questionable results. Herein we propose an extension of the crosswise model (ECWM) that makes it possible to detect several types of response biases with adequate power in realistic sample sizes. Importantly, the ECWM allows for testing the validity of the model's assumptions without any loss in statistical efficiency. Finally, we provide an empirical example supporting the usefulness of the ECWM.},

Official estimates of the number of injection drug users (IDUs), which rely on official registration of IDUs, greatly underestimate their number. We have combined official statistics that register HIV cases and attribute risk to causes including injection drug use with data from a study that collected data from IDUs about their HIV serostatus and their history of HIV testing to estimate the number of IDUs in the city. We conclude that there are 83,118~{\textpm}~5799 total IDUs. Since many IDUs have not been tested and even some who have been officially tested do not know their serostatus, a first step in countering the growing HIV epidemic among IDUs in St. Petersburg must be expanded access to HIV testing, prevention, and treatment that is targeted to IDUs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background Reducing neonatal and child mortality is a key component of the health-related sustainable development goal (SDG), but most low and middle income countries lack data to monitor child mortality on an annual basis. We tested a mortality monitoring system based on the continuous recording of pregnancies, births and deaths by trained community-based volunteers (CBV).   Methods and findings This project was implemented in 96 clusters located in three districts of the Northern Region of Ghana. Community-based volunteers (CBVs) were selected from these clusters and were trained in recording all pregnancies, births, and deaths among children under 5 in their catchment areas. Data collection lasted from January 2012 through September 2013. All CBVs transmitted tallies of recorded births and deaths to the Ghana Birth and deaths registry each month, except in one of the study districts (approximately 80\% reporting). Some events were reported only several months after they had occurred. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of CBV data by comparing them to retrospective full pregnancy histories (FPH) collected during a census of the same clusters conducted in October-December 2013. We conducted all analyses separately by district, as well as for the combined sample of all districts. During the 21-month implementation period, the CBVs reported a total of 2,819 births and 137 under-five deaths. Among the latter, there were 84 infant deaths (55 neonatal deaths and 29 post-neonatal deaths). Comparison of the CBV data with FPH data suggested that CBVs significantly under-estimated child mortality: the estimated under-5 mortality rate according to CBV data was only 2/3 of the rate estimated from FPH data (95\% Confidence Interval for the ratio of the two rates = 51.7 to 81.4). The discrepancies between the CBV and FPH estimates of infant and neonatal mortality were more limited, but varied significantly across districts.   Conclusions In northern Ghana, a community-based data collection systems relying on volunteers did not yield accurate estimates of child mortality rates. Additional implementation research is needed to improve the timeliness, completeness and accuracy of such systems. Enhancing pregnancy monitoring, in particular, may be an essential step to improve the measurement of neonatal mortality.},

In 1993 estimates were publicized that civilians use guns in self-defense against offenders upto 2.5 million times each year. Two aspects of the survey combine to create severe misestimation. The first is the likelihood of positive social desirability response sometimes referred to as personal presentation bias. The second aspect was the attempt to estimate a very rare event. Previous data on self-defense gun use came from two sources--the large National Crime Victimization surveys (NCVS) and smaller private surveys. NCVS results indicate that, nationally, victims use guns against offenders approximately 65,000 times per year. All surveys have problems with accuracy. Incorrect classifications come from a wide variety of causes including misunderstanding, miscoding, disremembering, misinterpretation of events, mischief or downright mendacity.},

Results from both samples provided evidence supporting the false consensus effect, that is, adolescents' reports of their friends' substance use were biased in the direction of their own use. Users and nonusers did not differ in accuracy of perceptions; however, across all substances and samples, they differed significantly in bias. Substance users displayed nearly perfect liberal bias, assuming their friends also used substances. Nonusers displayed an opposite, conservative bias, assuming their friends did not use substances. Gender and age differences in bias also were observed, with older adolescents and girls having more liberal biases than younger adolescents and boys. Results suggest the importance of differentiating the effects of actual and perceived peer substance use.},

One of the key parameters describing the transition from the susceptible to the infected class is the hazard of infection, often referred to as the force of infection. The force of infection reflects the degree of contact with potential for transmission between infected and susceptible individuals. The mathematical relation between the force of infection and effective contact patterns is generally assumed to be subjected to the mass action principle, which yields the necessary information to estimate the basic reproduction number, another key parameter in infectious disease epidemiology. It is within this context that the Center for Statistics (CenStat, I-Biostat, Hasselt University) and the Centre for the Evaluation of Vaccination and the Centre for Health Economic Research and Modelling Infectious Diseases (CEV, CHERMID, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp) have collaborated over the past 15 years. This book demonstrates the past and current research activities of these institutes and can be considered to be a milestone in this collaboration. This book is focused on the application of modern statistical methods and models to estimate infectious disease parameters. We want to provide the readers with software guidance, such as R packages, and with data, as far as they can be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) have been developed in several low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa and Asia. This paper reviews their history, state of the art and future potential and highlights substantial areas of contribution by the late Professor Peter Byass.Historically, HDSS appeared in the second half of the twentieth century, responding to a dearth of accurate population data in poorly resourced settings to contextualise the study of interventions to improve health and well-being. The progress of the development of this network is described starting with Pholela, and progressing through Gwembe, Balabgarh, Niakhar, Matlab, Navrongo, Agincourt, Farafenni, and Butajira, and the emergence of the INDEPTH Network in the early 1990'sThe paper describes the HDSS methodology, data, strengths, and limitations. The strengths are particularly their temporal coverage, detail, dense linkage, and the fact that they exist in chronically under-documented populations in LMICs where HDSS sites operate. The main limitations are generalisability to a national population and a potential Hawthorne effect, whereby the project itself may have changed characteristics of the population.The future will include advances in HDSS data harmonisation, accessibility, and protection. Key applications of the data are to validate and assess bias in other datasets. A strong collaboration between a national HDSS network and the national statistics office is modelled in South Africa and Sierra Leone, and it is possible that other low- to middle-income countries will see the benefit and take this approach.},

Going beyond the ideal gas scenario is seen to be tantamount to simulating the interactions taking place in a network's competitive cluster growth process. We find a scaling rule that allows to classify the final cluster-size distributions using only one parameter that we call the competitiveness. Empirical city-size distributions and electoral results can be thus reproduced and classified according to this competitiveness, which also allows to correctly predict well-established assessments such as the "six-degrees of separation", which is shown here to be a direct consequence of the maximum number of stable social relationships that one person can maintain, known as Dunbar's number. Finally, we show that scaled city-size distributions of large countries follow the same universal distribution.},

  abstract = {Background: The crude death rate (CDR) is one of the defining indicators of humanitarian emergencies. When data from vital registration systems are not available, it is common practice to estimate the CDR from household surveys with cluster-sampling design. However, sample sizes are often too small to compare mortality estimates to emergency thresholds, at least in a frequentist framework. Several authors have proposed Bayesian methods for health surveys in humanitarian crises. Here, we develop an approach specifically for mortality data and cluster-sampling surveys. Methods: We describe a Bayesian hierarchical Poisson--Gamma mixture model with generic (weakly informative) priors that could be used as default in absence of any specific prior knowledge, and compare Bayesian and frequentist CDR estimates using five different mortality datasets. We provide an interpretation of the Bayesian estimates in the context of an emergency threshold and demonstrate how to interpret parameters at the cluster level and ways in which informative priors can be introduced. Results: With the same set of weakly informative priors, Bayesian CDR estimates are equivalent to frequentist estimates, for all practical purposes. The probability that the CDR surpasses the emergency threshold can be derived directly from the posterior of the mean of the mixing distribution. All observation in the datasets contribute to the estimation of cluster-level estimates, through the hierarchical structure of the model. Conclusions: In a context of sparse data, Bayesian mortality assessments have advantages over frequentist ones already when using only weakly informative priors. More informative priors offer a formal and transparent way of combining new data with existing data and expert knowledge and can help to improve decision-making in humanitarian crises by complementing frequentist estimates.},

Survival probabilities are then related by regression analysis to the proportions with a particular characteristic, to yield an equation which can then be used to estimate the survival probability in a population. Maternal orphanhood and survival of first spouse by age have already shown themselves to be useful, and the new developments are only simplifications of the existing methodology. Survival of first spouse by duration of marriage, and survival of siblings are, however, new methods which have yet to be justified by field experience. In conclusion, the features common to all indirect mortality estimation procedures are outlined, and the direction future developments may take in response to gradually improving data quality is suggested.}

This paper evaluates the results of census-based measurement of pregnancy-related mortality using three different types of consistency checks applied in selected countries. Results from these evaluations are mixed. Overall, the census approach seems to produce robust estimates of the number of births. However, the consistency and plausibility of results relating to mortality vary substantially by country and by indicator. It is not clear whether the census-based methodology performs better or worse than the frequently used sibling histories. The results presented here clearly demonstrate the need for careful data evaluation and interpretation.},

We survey the diverse literature on such marketing with an emphasis on the statistical methods used and the data to which these methods have been applied. We also provide a discussion of challenges and opportunities for this burgeoning research topic. Our survey highlights a gap in the literature. Because of inadequate data, prior studies have not been able to provide direct, statistical support for the hypothesis that network linkage can directly affect product/service adoption. Using a new data set that represents the adoption of a new telecommunications service, we show very strong support for the hypothesis. Specifically, we show three main results: (1) ``Network neighbors''---those consumers linked to a prior customer---adopt the service at a rate 3--5 times greater than baseline groups selected by the best practices of the firm's marketing team. In addition, analyzing the network allows the firm to acquire new customers who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks, because they would not have been identified based on traditional attributes. (2) Statistical models, built with a very large amount of geographic, demographic and prior purchase data, are significantly and substantially improved by including network information. (3) More detailed network information allows the ranking of the network neighbors so as to permit the selection of small sets of individuals with very high probabilities of adoption.},

In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (\emph{R}\textsubscript{0}) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that \emph{R}\textsubscript{0} will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, we explore the use of a random geographic cluster sample (RGCS) as an alternative to the household-based sample. In this design, points are randomly selected and all eligible respondents found inside circles drawn around the selected points are interviewed. This approach should eliminate undercoverage of mobile populations. We present results of an RGCS survey with a total sample size of 784 households to measure livestock ownership in the Afar region of Ethiopia in 2012. We explore the RGCS data quality relative to a recent household survey, and discuss the implementation challenges.}

  abstract = {Are civilian attitudes a useful predictor of patterns of violence in civil wars? A prominent debate has emerged among scholars and practitioners about the importance of winning civilian `hearts and minds' for influencing their wartime behavior. We argue that such efforts may have a dark side: insurgents can use pro-counterinsurgent attitudes as cues to select their targets and tactics. We conduct an original survey experiment in 204 Afghan villages and establish a positive association between pro-International Security Assistance Force attitudes and future Taliban attacks. We extend our analysis to 14,606 non-surveyed villages and demonstrate that our measure of civilian attitudes improves out-of-sample predictive performance by 20--30\% over a standard forecasting model. The results are especially strong for Taliban attacks with improvised explosive devices. These improvements in predictive power remain even after adjusting for possible confounders, including past violence, military bases, and development aid.},

Friendships and other offline social ties have been repeatedly associated with human longevity, but online interactions might have different properties. Here, we reference 12 million social media profiles against California Department of Public Health vital records and use longitudinal statistical models to assess whether social media use is associated with longer life. The results show that receiving requests to connect as friends online is associated with reduced mortality but initiating friendships is not. Additionally, online behaviors that indicate face-to-face social activity (like posting photos) are associated with reduced mortality, but online-only behaviors (like sending messages) have a nonlinear relationship, where moderate use is associated with the lowest mortality. These results suggest that online social integration is linked to lower risk for a wide variety of critical health problems. Although this is an associational study, it may be an important step in understanding how, on a global scale, online social networks might be adapted to improve modern populations' social and physical health.}

  abstract = {Combining information from two data sources depends on finding records that belong to the same individual (matches). Sometimes, unique identifiers per individual are not available, and we have to rely on partially identifying variables that are registered in both data sources. A risk of relying on these variables is that some records from both datasets are wrongly linked to each other, which introduces bias in further regression analyses. In this paper, we propose a mixture model where we treat the indicator whether records belong to the same individual as missing. Each pair of records from both datasets contributes independently to a pairwise pseudo-likelihood, which we maximize with an expectation--maximization algorithm. Each part of the pseudo-likelihood is parameterized by the appropriate (parametric) density function. Moreover, some structures of the data allow for simplifying assumptions, which makes the pseudo-likelihood considerably easier to parameterize. Because the optimization requires a product over all combinations of records from both datasets, we suggest a procedure that summarizes information from highly unlikely matches. With simulations, we showed that the new approach produces accurate estimates in different linkage scenarios. Moreover, the estimator remained accurate in scenarios where previously proposed analysis approaches give biased results. We applied the method to estimation of the association between pregnancy duration of the first and second born children from the same mother from a register without mother identifier.

  abstract = {Social desirability and the fear of sanctions can deter survey respondents from responding truthfully to sensitive questions. Self-reports on norm breaking behavior such as shoplifting, non-voting, or tax evasion may thus be subject to considerable misreporting. To mitigate such response bias, various indirect question techniques, such as the randomized response technique (RRT), have been proposed. We evaluate the viability of several popular variants of the RRT, including the recently proposed crosswise-model RRT, by comparing respondents' self-reports on cheating in dice games to actual cheating behavior, thereby distinguishing between false negatives (underreporting) and false positives (overreporting). The study has been implemented as an online survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 6, 505). Our results from two validation designs indicate that the forced-response RRT and the unrelated-question RRT, as implemented in our survey, fail to reduce the level of misreporting compared to conventional direct questioning. For the crosswise-model RRT we do observe a reduction of false negatives. At the same time, however, there is a non-ignorable increase in false positives; a flaw that previous evaluation studies relying on comparative or aggregate-level validation could not detect. Overall, none of the evaluated indirect techniques outperformed conventional direct questioning. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the importance of identifying false negatives as well as false positives to avoid false conclusions about the validity of indirect sensitive question techniques.},

Yet, studies indicate that asking sensitive questions is problematic also in self-administered surveys. Because respondents might not be willing to reveal the truth and provide answers that are subject to social desirability bias, the validity of prevalence estimates of sensitive behaviors from online surveys can be challenged. A well-known method to overcome these problems is the Randomized Response Technique (RRT). However, convincing evidence that the RRT provides more valid estimates than direct questioning in online surveys is still lacking. We therefore conducted an experimental study in which different implementations of the RRT, including two implementations of the so-called crosswise model, were tested and compared to direct questioning. Our study is an online survey (N = 6,037) on sensitive behaviors by students such as cheating in exams and plagiarism. Results vary considerably between different implementations, indicating that practical details have a strong effect on the performance of the RRT. Among all tested implementations, including direct questioning, the unrelated-question crosswise-model RRT yielded the highest estimates of student misconduct.},

  abstract = {Validly measuring sensitive issues such as norm violations or stigmatizing traits through self-reports in surveys is often problematic. Special techniques for sensitive questions like the Randomized Response Technique (RRT) and, among its variants, the recent crosswise model should generate more honest answers by providing full response privacy. Different types of validation studies have examined whether these techniques actually improve data validity, with varying results. Yet, most of these studies did not consider the possibility of false positives, i.e., that respondents are misclassified as having a sensitive trait even though they actually do not. Assuming that respondents only falsely deny but never falsely admit possessing a sensitive trait, higher prevalence estimates have typically been interpreted as more valid estimates. If false positives occur, however, conclusions drawn under this assumption might be misleading. We present a comparative validation design that is able to detect false positives without the need for an individual-level validation criterion --- which is often unavailable. Results show that the most widely used crosswise-model implementation produced false positives to a nonignorable extent. This defect was not revealed by several previous validation studies that did not consider false positives --- apparently a blind spot in past sensitive question research.},

Data from studies with five overlapping, incomplete lists generated subgroups whose known sizes were compared with estimates derived from various four-source capture-recapture analyses. In 15 data sets unanalyzed previously (five subgroups of each of three new studies), the authors observed a trend toward mean underestimation of the known population size by 16-25\%. (Coverage of the 90\% confidence intervals associated with the method found to be optimal was acceptable (13/15), despite the downward bias.) The authors conjectured that (with the obvious exception of geographically disparate lists) most data sets used by epidemiologists tend to have a net positive dependence; that is, cases captured by one source are more likely to be captured by some other available source than are cases selected randomly from the population, and this trend results in a bias toward underestimation. Attempts to ensure that the underlying assumptions of the methods are met, such as minimizing (or adjusting adequately) for the possibility of loss due to death or migration, as was undertaken in one exceptional study, appear likely to improve the behavior of these methods.},

We apply them to a report of such an analysis of a measles epidemic [McGilchrist et al., J Clinical Epidemiol 1996, 49: 293-296] and to comments thereon by R. C. Cormack [J Clinical Epidemiol 1999; 52: 909-914]. The latter challenged the utility of the data on the measles outbreak for any reliable capture-recapture estimates. We suggest that, adopting the perspective of W. Edwards Deming, one can only make judgments as to the reliability of capture-recapture data, methods, and derived estimates in the light of (i.e., conditional upon) their eventual intended use. Capture-recapture approaches "unreliable" from one perspective may be "reliable," and/or more appropriately, "useful" from another. We consider the utility of ancillary and ad hoc information that may be available or worth seeking to supplement a capture-recapture analysis. We use information within the study of McGilchrist et al. to illustrate how, with such ancillary information, one may overcome the main thrust of the objections of Cormack in situations in which one observes apparently anomalous or hard to understand data structures. Making certain simple assumptions we regard as plausible, we estimate the number of affected in the measles epidemic as between about 700-1300. We derive this from data on 502 cases in a Register, an ad hoc sample of 91 cases in one age group in the general population, and the report of 41 cases in both of these. Our result is only 15-30\% the total implied by the estimates McGilchrist et al. derived with more complex methods and many assumptions in addition to our own. We discuss various approaches to evaluating "reliability" of our estimate conditional upon intended uses by policy makers.},

We address a number of factors that may influence communication effectiveness: the accessibility and extremity of political preferences, the distribution of preferences in the surrounding environment, disagreement between the senders and receivers of political messages, and the dynamic of the election campaign. The analysis is based on a study of the 1996 campaign, which interviewed citizens and discussion partners between March 1996 and January 1997. The citizens are a random sample of registered voters in the Indianapolis and St. Louis areas, and these registered voters identified the discussion partners as people with whom they discuss either "government, elections, and politics" or "important matters."},

Differential mortality studies often adopt descriptive approaches that are narrow in scope and conceptually ambiguous.

These include the modeling of differential mortality in a proximate determinants perspective, the incorporation of time into differential mortality models, the inclusion of more refined outcome easures, and the use of a macro-level perspective to better understand mortality differentials. Examples of recent studies expanding in these directions are briefly described.}

  abstract = {Background Contact patterns and vaccination decisions are fundamental to transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. We report on age-specific contact patterns in Japan and their effect on influenza vaccination behaviour. Methods Japanese adults (N=3146) were surveyed in Spring 2011 to assess the number of their social contacts within a 24 h period, defined as face-to-face conversations within 2 m, and gain insight into their influenza-related behaviour. We analysed the duration and location of contacts according to age. Additionally, we analysed the probability of vaccination and influenza infection in relation to the number of contacts controlling for individual's characteristics. Results The mean and median reported numbers of daily contacts were 15.3 and 12.0, respectively. School-aged children and young adults reported the greatest number of daily contacts, and individuals had the most contacts with those in the same age group. The age-specific contact patterns were different between men and women, and differed between weekdays and weekends. Children had fewer contacts between the same age groups during weekends than during weekdays, due to reduced contacts at school. The probability of vaccination increased with the number of contacts, controlling for age and household size. Influenza infection among unvaccinated individuals was higher than for those vaccinated, and increased with the number of contacts. Conclusions Contact patterns in Japan are age and gender specific. These contact patterns, as well as their interplay with vaccination decisions and infection risks, can help inform the parameterisation of mathematical models of disease transmission and the design of public health policies, to control disease transmission.},

  abstract = {The item count technique is a survey methodology that is designed to elicit respondents' truthful answers to sensitive questions such as racial prejudice and drug use. The method is also known as the list experiment or the unmatched count technique and is an alternative to the commonly used randomized response method. In this article, I propose new nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood estimators for efficient multivariate regression analysis with the item count technique. The two-step estimation procedure and the Expectation Maximization algorithm are developed to facilitate the computation. Enabling multivariate regression analysis is essential because researchers are typically interested in knowing how the probability of answering the sensitive question affirmatively varies as a function of respondents' characteristics. As an empirical illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to the 1991 National Race and Politics survey where the investigators used the item count technique to measure the degree of racial hatred in the United States. Small-scale simulation studies suggest that the maximum likelihood estimator can be substantially more efficient than alternative estimators. Statistical efficiency is an important concern for the item count technique because indirect questioning means loss of information. The open-source software is made available to implement the proposed methodology.},

Recently, multivariate regression techniques have been developed to predict the unobserved response to sensitive questions using respondent characteristics. Nevertheless, no method exists for using this predicted response as an explanatory variable in another regression model. We address this gap by first improving the performance of a naive two-step estimator. Despite its simplicity, this improved two-step estimator can only be applied to linear models and is statistically inefficient. We therefore develop a maximum likelihood estimator that is fully efficient and applicable to a wide range of models. We use a simulation study to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed methods. We also apply them to the Mexico 2012 Panel Study and examine whether vote-buying is associated with increased turnout and candidate approval. The proposed methods are implemented in open-source software.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of social contact patterns still represents the most critical step for understanding the spread of directly transmitted infections. Data on social contact patterns are, however, expensive to obtain. A major issue is then whether the simulation of synthetic societies might be helpful to reliably reconstruct such data. In this paper, we compute a variety of synthetic age-specific contact matrices through simulation of a simple individual-based model (IBM). The model is informed by Italian Time Use data and routine socio-demographic data (e.g., school and workplace attendance, household structure, etc.). The model is named ``Little Italy'' because each artificial agent is a clone of a real person. In other words, each agent's daily diary is the one observed in a corresponding real individual sampled in the Italian Time Use Survey. We also generated contact matrices from the socio-demographic model underlying the Italian IBM for pandemic prediction. These synthetic matrices are then validated against recently collected Italian serological data for Varicella (VZV) and ParvoVirus (B19). Their performance in fitting sero-profiles are compared with other matrices available for Italy, such as the Polymod matrix. Synthetic matrices show the same qualitative features of the ones estimated from sample surveys: for example, strong assortativeness and the presence of super- and sub-diagonal stripes related to contacts between parents and children. Once validated against serological data, Little Italy matrices fit worse than the Polymod one for VZV, but better than concurrent matrices for B19. This is the first occasion where synthetic contact matrices are systematically compared with real ones, and validated against epidemiological data. The results suggest that simple, carefully designed, synthetic matrices can provide a fruitful complementary approach to questionnaire-based matrices. The paper also supports the idea that, depending on the transmissibility level of the infection, either the number of different contacts, or repeated exposure, may be the key factor for transmission.},

In a population of 24,696 adults interacting face to face within 176 isolated villages in western Honduras, we measured all connections that were present, amounting to 105,175 positive and 16,448 negative ties. Here, we show that negative and positive ties exhibit many of the same structural characteristics. We then develop a complete taxonomy of all 138 possible triads of two-type relationships. Consistent with balance theory, we find that antagonists of friends and friends of antagonists tend to be antagonists; but, in an important empirical refutation of balance theory, we find that antagonists of antagonists also tend to be antagonists, not friends. Finally, villages with comparable levels of animosity tend to be geographically proximate. Similar processes, involving social contact, give rise to both positive and negative social ties in rural villages, and negative ties play an important role in social structure.},

We identify the conditions under which a behavior or disease diffuses and becomes persistent in the population.

In particular, we show that homophily can facilitate diffusion from a small initial seed of adopters.},

This feeds back to amplify engagement in behaviors that involve complementarities. Also, people with the greatest proclivity for a behavior choose to interact the most, leading to further feedback and amplification. These results are consistent with studies finding overestimation of peer consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs and with resulting high levels of drug and alcohol consumption.}

A new pattern of mixing, termed preferred mixing, is defined, in which a fraction of a group's contacts can be reserved for within-group contacts, the remainder being subject to proportional mixing. The fraction reserved may differ among groups. In addition, the classic definition of reproductive number is generalized to show that for heterogeneous populations in general the endemic threshold is BDc,, where cr is the mean number of contacts per infective. The most important finding is that the pattern of contacts between the different groups has a major effect on the spread of HIV, an effect inadequately recognized or studied heretofore.},

Yet, the study of intraparty politics remains underdeveloped as random samples are difficult to conduct among political activists.

As this method allows for quotas and the collection of large samples at relatively low cost, it becomes possible to improve the representativeness through poststratification and subsample robustness checks. Three examples illustrate these advantages of Facebook sampling: First, a Facebook sample approximated intraparty decisions and the outcome of a leadership contest of the Alternative for Germany. Second, a weighted Facebook sample achieved similar estimates as a representative local leader survey of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Third, by evaluating subgroups of key demographics for parties with unknown population parameters, two Facebook samples show that the color-coded conflict in Thailand was driven by different concepts of regime type, but not by a left--right divide on economic policy-making. Facebook sampling appears to be the best and cheapest method to conduct time-series cross-sectional studies for political activists.},

Prior studies have identified long ties, which connect people who lack mutual contacts, as a correlate of individuals' success within firms and places' economic prosperity. However, we lack population-scale evidence of the individual-level link between long ties and economic prosperity, and why some people have more long ties remains obscure. Here, using a social network constructed from interactions on Facebook, we establish a robust association between long ties and economic outcomes and study disruptive life events hypothesized to cause formation of long ties. Consistent with prior aggregated results, administrative units with a higher fraction of long ties tend to have higher-income and economic mobility. Individuals with more long ties live in higher-income places and have higher values of proxies for economic prosperity (e.g., using more Internet-connected devices and making more donations). Furthermore, having stronger long ties (i.e., with higher intensity of interaction) is associated with better outcomes, consistent with an advantage from the structural diversity constituted by long ties, rather than them being weak ties per se. We then study the role of disruptive life events in the formation of long ties. Individuals who have migrated between US states, have transferred between high schools, or have attended college out-of-state have a higher fraction of long ties among their contacts many years after the event. Overall, these results suggest that long ties are robustly associated with economic prosperity and highlight roles for important life experiences in developing and maintaining long ties.}

We aimed to investigate mortality in a population before and after the introduction of free antiretroviral therapy, and therefore to assess the effects of such programmes on survival at the population level. Methods We used a demographic surveillance system to measure mortality in a population of 32\hphantom{,}000 in northern Malawi, from August, 2002, when free antiretroviral therapy was not available in the study district, until February, 2006, 8 months after a clinic opened. Causes of death were established through verbal autopsies (retrospective interviews). Patients who registered for antiretroviral therapy at the clinic were identified and linked to the population under surveillance. Trends in mortality were analysed by age, sex, cause of death, and zone of residence. Findings Before antiretroviral therapy became available in June, 2005, mortality in adults (aged 15--59 years) was 9{$\cdot$}8 deaths for 1000 person-years of observation (95\% CI 8{$\cdot$}9--10{$\cdot$}9). The probability of dying between the ages of 15 and 60 years was 43\% (39--49) for men and 43\% (38--47) for women; 229 of 352 deaths (65{$\cdot$}1\%) were attributed to AIDS. 8 months after the clinic that provided antiretroviral therapy opened, 107 adults from the study population had accessed treatment, out of an estimated 334 in need of treatment. Overall mortality in adults had decreased by 10\% from 10{$\cdot$}2 to 8{$\cdot$}7 deaths for 1000 person-years of observation (adjusted rate ratio 0{$\cdot$}90, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}70--1{$\cdot$}14). Mortality was reduced by 35\% (adjusted rate ratio 0{$\cdot$}65, 0{$\cdot$}46--0{$\cdot$}92) in adults near the main road, where mortality before antiretroviral therapy was highest (from 13{$\cdot$}2 to 8{$\cdot$}5 deaths per 1000 person-years of observation before and after antiretroviral therapy). Mortality in adults aged 60 years or older did not change. Interpretation Our findings of a reduction in mortality in adults aged between 15 and 59 years, with no change in those older than 60 years, suggests that deaths from AIDS were averted by the rapid scale-up of free antiretroviral therapy in rural Malawi, which led to a decline in adult mortality that was detectable at the population level.

Design  In this self-report study, 513 participants (58.7\% male) from sports clubs across the UK and southern Ireland were asked to complete an anonymous survey containing the recently developed Single Sample Count (SSC), along with a comparative method Unrelated Question Model (UQM), using prohibited performance-enhancing drugs/substances (PED) as sensitive and hormone-boosting herbal supplements (HS) as non-sensitive control questions.  Method  The survey comprised of sections of SSC, UQM, social projection and simple network scale up methods. Respondents were asked to indicate whether they preferred the SSC or UQM for more protection and ease of completion.  Results  A large discrepancy was observed in prevalence estimates for PED using the UQM (58.4\%) and SSC (19.8\%), but not for HS (54.9\% and 54.0\%, respectively). The SSC prevalence estimate for PED was in keeping with the results from social projection (13.8\% in own sport; 26.1\% in all sports) and network scale up (19.3\% for known and suspected doping combined). A clear preference was logged for SSC.  Conclusion  SSC, but not UQM, showed good concurrent validity with social projection and personal networks for PED; and good discriminant validity with HS. The observed discrepancy could be explained by strategic responding which can inflate the proportion of `yes' answers in the UQM. Adaptation of the UQM for self-administration may lead to an unwanted upward response distortion via strategic responding.},

Data were collected on the occurrence of births, deaths, arrivals, and departures over the course of one year, and a retrospective survey was conducted at the end of the period to validate the information. Discrepancies between the two approaches were resolved by a third visit to the households with discordant records. The study found that the surveillance system was superior in terms of its specificity and sensitivity in measuring crude mortality and birth rates as compared to the survey, demonstrating the method's potential to measure accurately important population-level health metrics in an insecure setting in a timely, community-acceptable manner.},

  abstract = {Objectives Behavioral interventions are effective strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention and control. However, implementation of such strategies relies heavily on the accurate estimation of the high-risk population size. The multiplier method and generalized network scale-up method were recommended to estimate the population size of those at high risk for HIV by UNAIDS/WHO in 2003 and 2010, respectively. This study aims to assess and compare the two methods for estimating the size of populations at high risk for HIV, and to provide practical guidelines and suggestions for implementing the two methods. Methods Studies of the multiplier method used to estimate the population prevalence of men who have sex with men in China published between July 1, 2003 and July 1, 2013 were reviewed. The generalized network scale-up method was applied to estimate the population prevalence of men who have sex with men in the urban district of Taiyuan, China. Results The median of studies using the multiplier method to estimate the population prevalence of men who have sex with men in China was 4--8 times lower than the national level estimate. Meanwhile, the estimate of the generalized network scale-up method fell within the range of national level estimate. Conclusions When high-quality existing data are not readily available, the multiplier method frequently yields underestimated results. We thus suggest that the generalized network scale-up method is preferred when sampling frames for the general population and accurate demographic information are available.}

Mauritius has been expanding harm reduction and HIV services based in the belief that HIV prevalence amongst IDUs is somewhere between 30 and 60\% and the IDU population size is around 20,000. In 2009, the government of Mauritius conducted a survey to estimate the infection prevalence and risk factors and to estimate the population size of IDUs in order to more effectively expand programmes.Methods{$<$}br/{$>$}Men and women aged {$>$}15 years living in Mauritius and injecting illicit drugs in the past three months were recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). Consenting participants were interviewed about HIV-risk behaviours and tested for HIV, syphilis, HCV and HBV. Six multipliers were collected from service data and by the [`]unique identifier' method in conjunction with the RDS survey. Proportions were calculated using the RDS analysis tool.Results{$<$}br/{$>$}511 IDUs enrolled in the survey; 61.2\% reported injecting 2-3 times/day and 29.3\% reported past month injection with a previously used needle. Amongst the 60\% of IDUs who reported having sexual intercourse in the past three months, 39.5\% did so with {$>$}=2 partners. Almost all IDUs (98.1\%) reported inconsistent condom use in the past 12 months. HIV prevalence was 47.4\%, HCV 97.3\%, HBV 9.0\%, and syphilis 2.7\%; 99.7\% of those infected with HIV were also infected with HCV. Our population size estimates put the number of IDUs in Mauritius at around 9500, lower than previous estimates.Conclusions{$<$}br/{$>$}We observed high rates of HCV and HIV infection amongst IDUs in Mauritius. The scale up of targeted HCV and HIV prevention, care and treatment services for IDUs should be a high priority.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Recently included among the most vulnerable populations cited in the Morocco National Strategic Plans on HIV/TB for 2012--2016, sub-Saharan Africa migrants living in an irregular administrative situation participated in a survey to provide baseline data about their socio-demographic, sexual and HIV testing behaviors and HIV and syphilis prevalence. Two surveys using respondent driven sampling were conducted in 2013 among males and females, {$\geq$}18 years, originating from sub-Saharan African countries and living and/or working in an irregular administrative situation in Rabat and residing at least 3 months in Morocco. Analysis was conducted to evaluate differences between the two samples and between females and males within each sample using the successive sampling estimator in RDS Analyst. Roughly 3 \% of francophone and anglophone migrants were infected with HIV, whereas a statistically significantly higher percentage of francophone (2.8 \%), compared to anglophone (0.3 \%), migrants were infected with syphilis. Females were found to have HIV infection rates three times higher and past year sexually transmitted infection signs and symptoms more than two times higher than their male counterparts. Female migrants also had statistically significantly higher percentages of ever testing for HIV and HIV testing and receiving results in the past year compared to males. We found distinct and important differences between migrants depending on whether they come from francophone versus anglophone countries and whether they were male or female. Future research should continue to explore these differences, while policies and programs should note these differences to best allocate resources in providing social and health services to these populations.},

  abstract = {Summary Income diversification continues to be a key strategy for poor rural households, including those that are progressively developing and those operating under increasing distress. The ability of a household to diversify has been shown to depend upon its demographic and economic characteristics and its physical and social context. This paper considers the effects of intra-village social networks on household income diversification in one of the poorest and most ethnically diverse areas of the Indian state of Kerala. Using techniques adapted from spatial econometrics, we find that social connections within a village magnify the impacts of household characteristics such as education and number of adults by a factor of 3.6 times. Models with alternative measures of network centrality (degree and eigenvector) indicate that the number of network connections that a household has is more important than the centrality of those connections. Finally, we use social contact information to calculate assortative mixing based on caste. The results suggest social stratification in these villages, with higher levels of stratification associated with lower levels of income diversification.},

The results are taken from three household surveys conducted in Canberra during 1978--79 in which a multiplicity rule linking parents, siblings and children of residents of sample households who were also living in private dwellings in Canberra was used. While no direct evidence on the level of non-sampling error is available here, it appears that net response errors at least are not substantial using this multiplicity rule and that a reasonable gain in sampling efficiency results from the use of multiplicity.},

In NSUM surveys, sampled individuals report how many others they know in the subpopulation of interest (e.g. ?How many sex workers do you know??) and how many others they know in subpopulations of the general population (e.g. ?How many bus drivers do you know??). NSUM is widely used to estimate the size of important sociological and epidemiological risk groups, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, HIV+ individuals, and drug users. Unlike several other methods for population size estimation, NSUM requires only a single random sample and the estimator has a conveniently simple form. Despite its popularity, there are no published guidelines for the minimum sample size calculation to achieve a desired statistical precision. Here, we provide a sample size formula that can be employed in any NSUM survey. We show analytically and by simulation that the sample size controls error at the nominal rate and is robust to some forms of network model mis-specification. We apply this methodology to study the minimum sample size and relative error properties of several published NSUM surveys.},

  abstract = {Standard models of labor migration suggest that migration is induced by real income differentials across locations and will, ceteris paribus, serve to reduce those differentials. And yet there is evidence that growing spatial inequality may co-exist with increased migration from poorer to richer areas, at least over certain ranges. At a theoretical level, this raises the question of modeling opposing forces, for convergence and divergence, in a common framework, and identifying the precise conditions under which the tendency for convergence dominates, or is dominated by, the forces for divergence. A conventional route to introducing forces for divergence is to bring agglomeration effects into the standard setup. This paper explores an alternative route, based on a theoretical and empirical proposition of the migration literature, namely, that migration is a selective process. Focusing on skilled migration, the paper demonstrates the different forces in play that make selective migration a force for both divergence and convergence, and characterizes where each set of forces dominates. Finally, it explores the consequences for convergence of combining migration selectivity and agglomeration effects arising from migrant networks.}

  abstract = {We propose Diffusion Centrality (DC) in which semantic aspects of a social network are used to characterize vertices that are influential in diffusing a property p. In contrast to classical centrality measures, diffusion centrality of vertices varies with the property p, and depends on the diffusion model describing how p spreads. We show that DC applies to most known diffusion models including tipping, cascade, and homophilic models. We present a hypergraph-based algorithm (HyperDC) with many optimizations to exactly compute DC. However, HyperDC does not scale well to huge social networks (millions of vertices, tens of millions of edges). For scaling, we develop methods to coarsen a network and propose a heuristic algorithm called ``Coarsened Back and Forth'' (CBAF) to compute the top-k vertices (having the highest diffusion centrality). We report on experiments comparing DC with classical centrality measures in terms of runtime and the ``spread'' achieved by the k most central vertices (using 7 real-world social networks and 3 different diffusion models). Our experiments show that DC produces higher quality results and is comparable to several centrality measures in terms of runtime.},

Typically in non-research settings these claims are assessed using readily available but unverified self-reports from client loan applications. Alternatively, independent surveyors could directly elicit how borrowers spent their loan proceeds. That too, however, could suffer from deliberate misreporting. We use data from the Peru and the Philippines in which independent surveyors elicited loan use both directly (i.e., by asking how individuals spent their loan proceeds) and indirectly (i.e., through a list-randomization technique that allows individuals to hide their answer from the surveyor). We find that direct elicitation under-reports the non-enterprise uses of loan proceeds.},

  abstract = {Time--location sampling (TLS) is useful for collecting information on a hard-to-reach population (such as men who have sex with men [MSM]) by sampling locations where persons of interest can be found, and then sampling those who attend. These studies have typically been analyzed as a simple random sample (SRS) from the population of interest. If this population is the source population, as we assume here, such an analysis is likely to be biased, because it ignores possible associations between outcomes of interest and frequency of attendance at the locations sampled, and is likely to underestimate the uncertainty in the estimates, as a result of ignoring both the clustering within locations and the variation in the probability of sampling among members of the population who attend sampling locations. We propose that TLS data be analyzed as a two-stage sample survey using a simple weighting procedure based on the inverse of the approximate probability that a person was sampled and using sample survey analysis software to estimate the standard errors of estimates (to account for the effects of clustering within the first stage [locations] and variation in the weights). We use data from the Young Men's Survey Phase II, a study of MSM, to show that, compared with an analysis assuming a SRS, weighting can affect point prevalence estimates and estimates of associations and that weighting and clustering can substantially increase estimates of standard errors. We describe data on location attendance that would yield improved estimates of weights. We comment on the advantages and disadvantages of TLS and respondent-driven sampling.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.}

We aimed to measure levels and track trends in maternal mortality, the key causes contributing to maternal death, and timing of maternal death with respect to delivery. Methods We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine different causes, we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943 site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review of reports about the timing of maternal death, identifying 142 sources to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for 1990--2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all values. Findings 292\hphantom{,}982 (95\% UI 261\hphantom{,}017--327\hphantom{,}792) maternal deaths occurred in 2013, compared with 376\hphantom{,}034 (343\hphantom{,}483--407\hphantom{,}574) in 1990. The global annual rate of change in the MMR was -0{$\cdot$}3\% (--1{$\cdot$}1 to 0{$\cdot$}6) from 1990 to 2003, and -2{$\cdot$}7\% (--3{$\cdot$}9 to -1{$\cdot$}5) from 2003 to 2013, with evidence of continued acceleration. MMRs reduced consistently in south, east, and southeast Asia between 1990 and 2013, but maternal deaths increased in much of sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s. 2070 (1290--2866) maternal deaths were related to HIV in 2013, 0{$\cdot$}4\% (0{$\cdot$}2--0{$\cdot$}6) of the global total. MMR was highest in the oldest age groups in both 1990 and 2013. In 2013, most deaths occurred intrapartum or postpartum. Causes varied by region and between 1990 and 2013. We recorded substantial variation in the MMR by country in 2013, from 956{$\cdot$}8 (685{$\cdot$}1--1262{$\cdot$}8) in South Sudan to 2{$\cdot$}4 (1{$\cdot$}6--3{$\cdot$}6) in Iceland. Interpretation Global rates of change suggest that only 16 countries will achieve the MDG 5 target by 2015. Accelerated reductions since the Millennium Declaration in 2000 coincide with increased development assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health. Setting of targets and associated interventions for after 2015 will need careful consideration of regions that are making slow progress, such as west and central Africa.

However, it has long been recognized that spatial and social structure are important if we are to understand the long--term persistence and detailed behaviour of disease. We will introduce three pair models which attempt to capture the underlying heterogeneous structure by studying the connections and correlations between individuals. Although modelling the correlations necessarily leads to more complex equations, this pair formulation naturally incorporates the local dynamical behaviour generating more realistic persistence. In common with other studies on childhood diseases we will focus our attention on measles, for which the case returns are particularly well documented and long running.}

This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches.Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases through vaccination, quarantine, or culling.Comprehensive, practical introduction to infectious disease modelingBuilds from simple to complex predictive modelsModels and methodology fully supported by examples drawn from research literaturePractical models aid students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological processesFor many of the models presented, the authors provide accompanying programs written in Java, C, Fortran, and MATLABIn-depth treatment of role of modeling in understanding disease control},

For the goal of estimating average treatment effects, we propose to fit a model allowing treatment to interact with background variables and then average over the distribution of these variables in the population. This can be seen as an extension of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP), a method used in political science and other areas of survey research, where researchers wish to generalize from a sparse and possibly non-representative sample to the general population. In this paper, we discuss areas where this method can be used in the psychological sciences. We use our method to estimate the norming distribution for the Big Five Personality Scale using open source data. We argue that large open data sources like this and other collaborative data sources can be combined with MRP to help resolve current challenges of generalizability and replication in psychology.},

Citizens living in societies with a high degree of social cohesion --- characterized by strong social networks and high levels of interpersonal trust --- seem to be healthier than those living in socially disorganized societies. Epidemiologists have become interested in notions of civil society and social capital to explain variations in health across societies. The purpose of the present paper was to examine the role of social capital in the Russian mortality crisis. Social capital has been defined as those features of social organization --- such as the density of civic associations, levels of interpersonal trust, and norms of reciprocity --- that act as resources for individuals, and facilitate collective action. A civil society is one that is rich in stocks of social capital. Various scholars have argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Soviet regime was the paucity of civil society. Using household survey data from the Ail-Russian Center for Public Opinion research (VTsIOM), we carried out a cross-sectional, ecologie analysis of the association between indicators of social capital and mortality rates across 40 regions of Russia. We found associations between indicators of social capital (mistrust in government, crime, quality of work relations, civic engagement in politics) and life expectancy, as well as mortality rates. In the absence of civil society, it is believed that far more people in post-Soviet Russia rely on informal sources of support (friends, family) to deal with their day to day problems. Those lacking such sources of support may have been especially vulnerable to the economic hardships following the transformation to a market economy.},

We find that internet access has a moderate, positive short-run impact on school-average standardized math scores, but importantly that this effect grows over time. We provide evidence that schools require time to adapt to internet access by hiring teachers with computer training and that this process is not immediate.

  abstract = {Postmenopausal longevity may have evolved in our lineage when ancestral grandmothers subsidized their daughters' fertility by provisioning grandchildren, but the verbal hypothesis has lacked mathematical support until now. Here, we present a formal simulation in which life spans similar to those of modern chimpanzees lengthen into the modern human range as a consequence of grandmother effects. Greater longevity raises the chance of living through the fertile years but is opposed by costs that differ for the sexes. Our grandmother assumptions are restrictive. Only females who are no longer fertile themselves are eligible, and female fertility extends to age 45 years. Initially, there are very few eligible grandmothers and effects are small. Grandmothers can support only one dependent at a time and do not care selectively for their daughters' offspring. They must take the oldest juveniles still relying on mothers; and infants under the age of 2 years are never eligible for subsidy. Our model includes no assumptions about brains, learning or pair bonds. Grandmother effects alone are sufficient to propel the doubling of life spans in less than sixty thousand years.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground Information and behaviour can spread through interpersonal ties. By targeting influential individuals, health interventions that harness the distributive properties of social networks could be made more effective and efficient than those that do not. Our aim was to assess which targeting methods produce the greatest cascades or spillover effects and hence maximise population-level behaviour change. Methods In this cluster randomised trial, participants were recruited from villages of the Department of Lempira, Honduras. We blocked villages on the basis of network size, socioeconomic status, and baseline rates of water purification, for delivery of two public health interventions: chlorine for water purification and multivitamins for micronutrient deficiencies. We then randomised villages, separately for each intervention, to one of three targeting methods, introducing the interventions to 5\% samples composed of either: randomly selected villagers (n=9 villages for each intervention); villagers with the most social ties (n=9); or nominated friends of random villagers (n=9; the last strategy exploiting the so-called friendship paradox of social networks). Participants and data collectors were not aware of the targeting methods. Primary endpoints were the proportions of available products redeemed by the entire population under each targeting method. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01672580. Findings Between Aug 4, and Aug 14, 2012, 32 villages in rural Honduras (25--541 participants each; total study population of 5773) received public health interventions. For each intervention, nine villages (each with 1--20 initial target individuals) were randomised, using a blocked design, to each of the three targeting methods. In nomination-targeted villages, 951 (74{$\cdot$}3\%) of 1280 available multivitamin tickets were redeemed compared with 940 (66{$\cdot$}2\%) of 1420 in randomly targeted villages and 744 (61{$\cdot$}0\%) of 1220 in indegree-targeted villages. All pairwise differences in redemption rates were significant (p\&lt;0{$\cdot$}01) after correction for multiple comparisons. Targeting nominated friends increased adoption of the nutritional intervention by 12{$\cdot$}2\% compared with random targeting (95\% CI 6{$\cdot$}9--17{$\cdot$}9). Targeting the most highly connected individuals, by contrast, produced no greater adoption of either intervention, compared with random targeting. Interpretation Introduction of a health intervention to the nominated friends of random individuals can enhance that intervention's diffusion by exploiting intrinsic properties of human social networks. This method has the additional advantage of scalability because it can be implemented without mapping the network. Deployment of certain types of health interventions via network targeting, without increasing the number of individuals targeted or the resources used, could enhance the adoption and efficiency of those interventions, thereby improving population health.

In the course of reviewing subsequent research that has made progress in addressing these challenges, we identify both potential limits and possibilities for the SWT thesis. We argue for the importance of identifying how actors' agency---i.e., the way people use their ties---may affect social networks' value. We conclude by summarizing some outstanding questions that progress on the SWT thesis has generated. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Sociology, Volume 49 is July 2023.

To do this, we have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future---and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.},

Data on symptoms reported by caregivers along with the cause of death are collected from a medical facility, and the cause-of-death distribution is estimated in the population where only symptom data are available. Current approaches analyze only one cause at a time, involve assumptions judged difficult or impossible to satisfy, and require expensive, time-consuming, or unreliable physician reviews, expert algorithms, or parametric statistical models. By generalizing current approaches to analyze multiple causes, we show how most of the difficult assumptions underlying existing methods can be dropped. These generalizations also make physician review, expert algorithms and parametric statistical assumptions unnecessary. With theoretical results, and empirical analyses in data from China and Tanzania, we illustrate the accuracy of this approach. While no method of analyzing verbal autopsy data, including the more computationally intensive approach offered here, can give accurate estimates in all circumstances, the procedure offered is conceptually simpler, less expensive, more general, as or more replicable, and easier to use in practice than existing approaches. We also show how our focus on estimating aggregate proportions, which are the quantities of primary interest in verbal autopsy studies, may also greatly reduce the assumptions necessary for, and thus improve the performance of, many individual classifiers in this and other areas. As a companion to this paper, we also offer easy-to-use software that implements the methods discussed herein.}

The cost of the reentry, combined with the low error rate typical in controlled clinical trials suggests to some that single data entry may be sufficient, with the cost of reentry allocated to more productive quality assurance tools. In this article, an alternative approach to limiting costs and maintaining the quality of entered data is offered. The technique is a formal, adaptive method for choosing a subset of forms to be reentered. The idea behind the approach is to decide whether a given form should be reentered on a form-by-form basis for each data entry person, using an estimated probability that the form contains an error as a guideline. The method automatically adapts to each data entry person and to temporal changes in accuracy within data entry person. The estimated probability is based on a lagged set of the most recently double-data-entered forms. A simple simulation shows that much of the reentry can be avoided while still detecting many of the errors. A real data example demonstrates that the procedure can be effective in practice as well.

  abstract = {Social mixing patterns are crucial in driving transmission of infectious diseases and informing public health interventions to contain their spread. Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.},

Central to the documentary is a nationwide citizen science experiment, during which volunteers in the United Kingdom could download and use a custom mobile phone app called BBC Pandemic, and contribute their movement and contact data for a day. As the `maths team', we were asked to use the data from the app to build and run a model of how a pandemic would spread in the UK. The headline results are presented in the TV programme. Here, we document in detail how the model works, and how we shaped it according the incredibly rich data coming from the BBC Pandemic app. We have barely scratched the depth of the volunteer data available from the app. The work presented in this article had the sole purpose of generating a single detailed simulation of a pandemic influenza-like outbreak in the UK. When the BBC Pandemic app has completed its collection period, the vast dataset will be made available to the scientific community (expected early 2019). It will take much more time and input from a broad range of researchers to fully exploit all that this dataset has to offer. But here at least we were able to harness some of the power of the BBC Pandemic data to contribute something which we hope will capture the interest and engagement of a broad audience.},

  abstract = {Context: Although the reduction of maternal mortality levels is a key Millennium Development Goal, community-based evidence on obstetric complications and maternal care-seeking behavior remains limited in low-resource countries. Methods: This study presents an overview of key findings from the 2001 Bangladesh Maternal Health Services and Maternal Mortality Survey of ever-married women aged 13-49. The survey collected data on the prevalence of obstetric complications, women's knowledge of life-threatening complications, treatment-seeking behavior and reasons for delay in seeking medical care. Results: Bangladeshi women report low but increasing use of antenatal care, as well as low rates of delivery in a health facility or with the assistance of a skilled provider. Although almost half of women reported having one or more complications during pregnancy that they perceived as life threatening, only one in three sought treatment from a qualified provider. More than three-fourths of women with the time-sensitive complications of convulsions or excessive bleeding either failed to seek any treatment or sought treatment from an unqualified provider. The principal reason cited for failing to seek care for life-threatening complications was concern over medical costs, and pronounced socioeconomic disparities were found for maternal care-seeking behavior in both urban and rural Bangladesh. Conclusions: Despite these gaps in access to skilled delivery and effective emergency obstetric care, some progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality levels. Improved obstetric care and declining levels of fertility and unwanted pregnancy may have played critical roles in addressing the maternal health care needs of Bangladeshi women. /// Contexto: Si bien la reducci{\'o}n de los niveles de la mortalidad materna es una meta clave de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio, en los pa{\'i}ses de bajos recursos contin{\'u}an siendo limitadas las posibilidades de lograr asistencia a nivel comunitario para casos de complicaciones obst{\'e}tricas y de atenci{\'o}n materna. M{\'e}todos: En este estudio se presenta un panorama general de datos clave identificados a trav{\'e}s de la Encuesta de Servicios de Salud Materna de Bangladesh y de la Encuesta sobre Mortalidad Materna, de 2001, realizadas a mujeres que alguna vez estuvieron casadas, de 13-49 a{\~n}os de edad. Estas encuestas recopilaron datos sobre la prevalencia de las complicaciones obst{\'e}tricas, sobre el conocimiento que tuvieran las mujeres sobre las complicaciones que constitu{\'i}an riesgo de vida, su conducta para procurar un tratamiento adecuado y sobre las razones por las cuales se demoraban en obtener atenci{\'o}n m{\'e}dica. Resultados: Las mujeres de Bangladesh indicaron que hac{\'i}an poco pero creciente uso de la atenci{\'o}n prenatal, y presentaron bajas tasas de uso de instalaciones de atenci{\'o}n de la salud para el parto o de asistencia por parte de un proveedor de salud especializado. Aunque casi la mitad de las mujeres indic{\'o} que hab{\'i}an tenido una o m{\'a}s complicaciones durante su embarazo, que ellas hab{\'i}an percibido como complicaciones con riesgo de vida, solo una de cada tres procur{\'o} tratamiento m{\'e}dico por parte de un proveedor de salud calificado. M{\'a}s del setenta y cinco por ciento de las mujeres que tuvieron episodios de complicaciones de convulsiones o un sangrado excesivo, o no procuraron asistencia o recurrieron a un proveedor no calificado. Mencionaron como la causa principal de esta conducta de no procurar atenci{\'o}n m{\'e}dica en una situaci{\'o}n de complicaciones de riesgo de vida a su preocupaci{\'o}n por los altos costos de este servicio. Las pronunciadas disparidades socioecon{\'o}micas influyeron en la conducta observada con respecto a la atenci{\'o}n materna, tanto en las zonas urbanas como rurales de Bangladesh. Conclusiones: A pesar de estas disparidades y brechas de acceso a la atenci{\'o}n especializada y eficaz para casos de emergencia obst{\'e}trica, se han logrado ciertos avances al reducirse los niveles de la mortalidad maternal. Una mejor atenci{\'o}n obst{\'e}trica y la disminuci{\'o}n de los niveles de fecundidad y de embarazos no deseados han desempe{\~n}ado un papel esencial al abordar las necesidades de salud materna de las mujeres de Bangladesh. /// Contexte: La r{\'e}duction des niveaux de mortalit{\'e} maternelle figure parmi les principaux objectifs de d{\'e}veloppement du mill{\'e}naire, mais la documentation communautaire des complications obst{\'e}triques et des comportements de recours aux soins de sant{\'e} maternelle demeure limit{\'e}e dans les pays {\`a} faibles ressources.

We used administrative register data of the full population of Sweden to provide the first kinship enumeration for a complete population based on empirical data. We created ego-focused kinship networks of children, parents, siblings, grandchildren, grandparents, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, and cousins. We show the average number of kin of different types, the distribution of the number of kin, and changes in dispersion over time. A large share of all kin of an individual are horizontal kin, such as cousins. We observe the highest number of kin---on average, roughly 20---around age 35. We show differences between matrilineal and patrilineal kin and differences in the kinship structure arising from fertility with more than one childbearing partner, such as half-siblings. The results demonstrate substantial variability in kinship within a population. We discuss our findings in the context of other methods to estimate kinship.}

Contact matrices, usually stratified by age, summarise interaction motifs efficiently, but their collection relies on conventional representative survey techniques, which are expensive and slow to obtain. Here we report a data collection effort involving over                                                   \$\$2.3{\textbackslash}\%\$\$                                                               2.3                       \%                                                                                       of the Hungarian population to simultaneously record contact matrices through a longitudinal online and sequence of representative phone surveys. To correct non-representative biases characterising the online data, by using census data and the representative samples we develop a reconstruction method to provide a scalable, cheap, and flexible way to dynamically obtain closer-to-representative contact matrices. Our results demonstrate that although some conventional socio-demographic characters correlate significantly with the change of contact numbers, the strongest predictors can be collected only via surveys techniques and combined with census data for the best reconstruction performance. We demonstrate the potential of combined online-offline data collections to understand the changing behavioural responses determining the future evolution of the outbreak, and to inform epidemic models with crucial data.},

Here we study the temporal dynamics of communication using on-line data, including e-mail communication among the faculty and staff of a large university over a two-year period. We formulate a temporal notion of "distance" in the underlying social network by measuring the minimum time required for information to spread from one node to another - a concept that draws on the notion of vector-clocks from the study of distributed computing systems. We find that such temporal measures provide structural insights that are not apparent from analyses of the pure social network topology. In particular, we define the network backbone to be the subgraph consisting of edges on which information has the potential to flow the quickest. We find that the backbone is a sparse graph with a concentration of both highly embedded edges and long-range bridges - a finding that sheds new light on the relationship between tie strength and connectivity in social networks.},

  abstract = {List experiments (LEs) are an increasingly popular survey research tool for measuring sensitive attitudes and behaviors. However, there is evidence that list experiments sometimes produce unreasonable estimates. Why do list experiments ``fail,'' and how can the performance of the list experiment be improved? Using evidence from Kenya, we hypothesize that the length and complexity of the LE format make them costlier for respondents to complete and thus prone to comprehension and reporting errors. First, we show that list experiments encounter difficulties with simple, nonsensitive lists about food consumption and daily activities: over 40 percent of respondents provide inconsistent responses between list experiment and direct question formats. These errors are concentrated among less numerate and less educated respondents, offering evidence that the errors are driven by the complexity and difficulty of list experiments. Second, we examine list experiments measuring attitudes about political violence. The standard list experiment reveals lower rates of support for political violence compared to simply asking directly about this sensitive attitude, which we interpret as list experiment breakdown. We evaluate two modifications to the list experiment designed to reduce its complexity: private tabulation and cartoon visual aids. Both modifications greatly enhance list experiment performance, especially among respondent subgroups where the standard procedure is most problematic. The paper makes two key contributions: (1) showing that techniques such as the list experiment, which have promise for reducing response bias, can introduce different forms of error associated with question complexity and difficulty; and (2) demonstrating the effectiveness of easy-to-implement solutions to the problem.}

  abstract = {Background For understanding the spread of infectious diseases it is crucial to have knowledge of the patterns of contacts in a population during which the infection can be transmitted. Besides contact rates and mixing between age groups, the way individuals distribute their contacts across different locations may play an important role in determining how infections spread through a population. Methods and Findings Representative surveys were performed in eight countries to assess the number of social contacts (talking to another person at close distance either with or without physical contact), using a diary approach in which participants recorded individual contacts. The overall sample size was 7290 respondents. We analyzed the reported numbers of contacts per respondent in six different settings (household, work, school, leisure, transportation and others) to define different contact profiles. The identification of the profiles and classification of respondents according to these profiles was conducted using a two-step cluster analysis algorithm as implemented in SPSS. We identified seven distinct contact profiles: respondents having (1) mixed: contacts predominantly at school, during transportation and leisure time, (2) contacts during leisure time, (3) contacts mainly in the household (large family), (4) contacts at work, (5) contacts solely at school, (6) contacts in other places and finally (7) respondents having a low number of contacts in any setting. Similar contact profiles can be found in all eight European countries which participated in the study. The distributions of respondents across the profiles were similar in all countries. The profiles are dominated by work, school and household contacts. But also contacts during leisure activities play an important role in the daily lives of a large fraction of individuals. A surprisingly large number of individuals has only few contacts in all locations. There was a distinct age-dependence in the distribution of the population across contact profiles. Conclusions In contrast with earlier studies that focussed on the contribution of different age groups to the spread of an infectious disease, our results open up the opportunity to analyze how an infection spreads between locations and how locations as work or school are interconnected via household contacts. Mathematical models that take these local contact patterns into account can be used to assess the effect of intervention measures like school closure and cancelling of leisure activities on the spread of influenza.},

Satisficing may lead respondents to employ a variety of response strategies, including choosing the first response alternative that seems to constitute a reasonable answer, agreeing with an assertion made by a question, endorsing the               status quo               instead of endorsing social change, failing to differentiate among a set of diverse objects in ratings, saying `don't know' instead of reporting an opinion, and randomly choosing among the response alternatives offered. This paper specifies a wide range of factors that are likely to encourage satisficing, and reviews relevant evidence evaluating these speculations.

Unlike the vast majority of RRT surveys measuring the prevalence of socially undesirable behaviors, only few studies have explored the effectiveness of the RRT with respect to the disclosure of socially undesirable opinions. Results suggest that the RRT is an effective method eliciting more socially undesirable opinions and yielding more valid prevalence estimates of xenophobia and anti-Semitism than direct questioning (`more-is-better' assumption). Furthermore, the results indicate that with increasing topic sensitivity, the benefits of using the RRT also increase. Finally, adapted logistic regression analyses show that several covariates such as education and generalized trust are related to the likelihood of being prejudiced towards foreigners and Jews.},

  abstract = {Variability in the risk of transmission for respiratory pathogens can result from several factors, including the intrinsic properties of the pathogen, the immune state of the host and the host's behaviour. It has been proposed that self-reported social mixing patterns can explain the behavioural component of this variability, with simulated intervention studies based on these data used routinely to inform public health policy. However, in the absence of robust studies with biological endpoints for individuals, it is unclear how age and social behaviour contribute to infection risk. To examine how the structure and nature of social contacts influenced infection risk over the course of a single epidemic, we designed a flexible disease modelling framework: the population was divided into a series of increasingly detailed age and social contact classes, with the transmissibility of each age-contact class determined by the average contacts of that class. Fitting the models to serologically confirmed infection data from the 2009 Hong Kong influenza A/H1N1p pandemic, we found that an individual's risk of infection was influenced strongly by the average reported social mixing behaviour of their age group, rather than by their personal reported contacts. We also identified the resolution of social mixing that shaped transmission: epidemic dynamics were driven by intense contacts between children, a post-childhood drop in risky contacts and a subsequent rise in contacts for individuals aged 35--50. Our results demonstrate that self-reported social contact surveys can account for age-associated heterogeneity in the transmission of a respiratory pathogen in humans, and show robustly how these individual-level behaviours manifest themselves through assortative age groups. Our results suggest it is possible to profile the social structure of different populations and to use these aggregated data to predict their inherent transmission potential.},

Preliminary evidence also indicates that this prejudice is concentrated among white southern men Comparison of these results with responses to traditional survey questions suggests that social desirability contaminates the latter.

Although age-specific mixing patterns are often assumed to be the key drivers of the age-specific heterogeneity in transmission, the association between social contacts and biologically confirmed infection has not previously been tested at the individual level. We administered a questionnaire to participants in a longitudinal cohort survey of influenza in which infection was defined by longitudinal paired serology. Using a variety of statistical approaches, we found overwhelming support for the inclusion of individual age in addition to contact variables when explaining odds of infection: the best model not including age explained only 15.7\% of the deviance, whereas the best model with age explained 23.6\%. However, within age groups, we did observe an association between contacts, locations and infection: median numbers of contacts (or locations) reported by those infected were higher than those from the uninfected group in every age group other than the youngest. Further, we found some support for the retention of location and contact variables in addition to age in our regression models, with excess odds of infection of approximately 10\% per additional 10 contacts or one location. These results suggest that, although the relationship between age and incidence of respiratory infection at the level of the individual is not driven by self-reported social contacts, risk within an age group may be.},

To achieve the goal of reducing HIV infections in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in cooperation with state and local health departments, implemented the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) for injecting drug users (IDUs) in 25 selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) throughout the United States in 2005. The surveillance system used respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a modified chain-referral method, to recruit IDUs for a survey measuring HIV-associated drug use and sexual risk behavior. RDS can produce population estimates for specific risk behaviors and demographic characteristics. Formative assessment activities---primarily the collection of qualitative data---provided information to better understand the IDU population and implement the surveillance activities in each city. This is the first behavioral surveillance system of its kind in the U.S. that will provide local and national data on risk for HIV and other blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections among IDUs for monitoring changes in the epidemic and prevention programs.}

Many theories posit that information flows more easily in ethnically homogeneous areas, facilitating collective action, because social networks among coethnics are denser. Although this characterization is ubiquitous, little empirical work assesses it. Through a novel field experiment in a matched pair of villages in rural Uganda, this article directly examines word-of-mouth information spread and its relationship to ethnic diversity and networks. As expected, information spread more widely in the homogeneous village. However, unexpectedly, the more diverse village's network is significantly denser. Using unusually detailed network data, we offer an explanation for why network density may hamper information dissemination in heterogeneous areas, showing why even slight hesitation to share information with people from other groups can have large aggregate effects.},

  abstract = {We conducted an internet survey using Survey Monkey over six weeks to evaluate the impact of the government interventions on social contact patterns in Luxembourg. Participants were recruited via the science.lu website on March 25, April 2, April 16, May 1 during lockdown, and June 12 and June 25 after the lockdown to provide an estimate of their number of contacts within the previous 24 hours. During the lockdown, a total of 5,644 survey participants with a mean age of 44.2 years reported 18,118 contacts (mean = 3.2, IQR 1--4). The average number of contacts per day increased by 24\% from 2.9 to 3.6 over the lockdown period. The average number of contacts decreased with age: 4.2 (IQR 2--5) for participants below 25 years and 1.7 (IQR 1--2) for participants above 64 years. Residents of Portuguese nationality reported a higher number of contacts (mean = 4.3, IQR 2--5) than Luxembourgish (mean = 3.5, IQR 2--4) or other foreign residents, respectively. After lockdown, 1,119 participants reported 7,974 contacts with 7.1 (IQR 3--9) contacts per day on average, of which 61.7\% (4,917/7,974) occurred without a facemask (mean = 4.9, IQR 2--6). While the number of social contacts was substantially lower during the lockdown by more than 80\% compared to the pre-pandemic period, we observed a more recent 121\% increase during the post lockdown period showing an increased potential for COVID-19 spread. Monitoring social contacts is an important indicator to estimate the possible impact of government interventions on social contacts and the COVID-19 spread in the coming months.},

  abstract = {This analysis of friends of urban men is guided by methodological and substantive considerations. Methodologically, we have assessed the accuracy with which respondents report social attributes and characteristics of their friends. Errors are less frequent for relatively objective characteristics (age, occupation) than for the less visible and public characteristics of the friend (political attitudes). Where errors occur, they are in the direction of the respondent ascribing his own characteristics to his friend. Substantively, we have addressed ourselves to the question of estimating the degree of mutual choice of friends in an adult urban population, friends being named unconstrained by any criteria of selection, and of assessing the degree of attitude similarity between friends and the relevance of reciprocated choice in enhancing attitude similarity. Reciprocity of friendship choice is seen to be related to frequency of contact, closeness of the friendship, and spatial proximity. In addition, there is some support for the hypothesis that reciprocity of friendship is associated with a greater homogeneity of attitudes than is the case in nonreciprocated pairs of friends.}

(The GSS asks respondents whether they know a person with AIDS [PWA].) The gender, racial, age, and regional composition of the set of PWAs reported by GSS respondents is compared with that of the official AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In an attempt to assess the accuracy of the GSS estimates, a similar analysis is performed in which GSS respondents are asked whether they know a homicide victim. Data from four consecutive GSS samples (1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991) are used, permitting a more detailed exploration of potential biases and problems with the network technique. In addition, time series data from the National Health Interview Survey on the percentage of people who know at least one PWA are used to validate the GSS data. Our earlier findings, that the GSS identifies proportionately more White and midwestern cases than are reported to the CDC, are corroborated by the additional data. Possible explanations for these discrepancies are given, and suggestions are made for improving the utility of the approach.},

Critics, however, raise the possibility that these polls are plagued by social desirability bias, and thereby may overstate public support for gay and lesbian rights. We test this proposition using a list experiment embedded in the 2013 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. List experiments afford respondents an anonymity that allows them to provide more truthful answers to potentially sensitive survey items. Our experiment finds no evidence that social desirability is affecting overall survey results. If there is social desirability in polling on same-sex marriage, it pushes in both directions. Indeed, our efforts provide new evidence that a national opinion majority favors same-sex marriage. To evaluate the robustness of our findings, we analyze a second list experiment, this one focusing on the inclusion of sexual orientation in employment nondiscrimination laws. Again, we find no overall evidence of bias.}

In this combination, the design weights are adjusted by propensity scores to correct for selection bias due to nonrandomized sampling. These adjusted weights are then calibrated to control totals for the target population and correct for coverage bias. The final set of weights is comprised of multiple components, and the estimator of a total no longer takes a linear form. Therefore, approximate methods are needed to derive variance estimates. This study compares three variance estimation methods through simulation. The first method resembles what is used in commercial statistical software based on squared residuals. The second approach uses a variance estimator originally derived for the generalized regression estimator. The third method uses jackknife replication. Results indicate bias reduction is crucial for valid variance estimation and favor the replication method over the other approaches.},

Several methodological artifacts seem unlikely to account for the effect. We show that in this period, more than before, ``important matters'' were often framed as political matters, and that this association probably accounts for the smaller networks.},

The meta-analyses focus on the performance of RRTs compared to conventional question-and-answer methods. The authors use the percentage of incorrect answers as effect size for the individual validation studies and the standardized difference score (d-probit) as effect size for the comparative studies. Results indicate that compared to other methods, randomized response designs result in more valid data. For the individual validation studies, the mean percentage of incorrect answers for the RRT condition is .38; for the other conditions, it is .49. The more sensitive the topic under investigation, the higher the validity of RRT results. However, both meta-analyses have unexplained residual variances across studies, which indicates that RRTs are not completely under the control of the researcher.},

  abstract = {Rationale Social desirability bias, which is the tendency to under-report socially, undesirable health behaviours, significantly distorts information on sensitive behaviours, gained from self-reports and prevents accurate estimation of the prevalence of those, behaviours. We contribute to a growing body of literature that seeks to assess the performance of the list experiment method to improve estimation of these sensitive health behaviours. Method We use a double-list experiment design in which respondents serve as the treatment group for one list and as the control group for the other list to estimate the prevalence of two sensitive health behaviours in different settings: condom use among 500 female sex workers in urban Senegal and physical intimate partner violence among 1700 partnered women in rural Burkina Faso. First, to assess whether the list experiment improves the accuracy of estimations of the prevalence of sensitive behaviours, we compare the prevalence rates estimated from self-reports with those elicited through the list experiment. Second, we test whether the prevalence rates of the sensitive behaviours obtained using the double-list design are similar, and we estimate the reduction in the standard errors obtained with this design. Finally, we compare the results obtained through another indirect elicitation method, the polling vote method. Results We show that the list experiment method reduces misreporting by 17 percentage points for condom use and 16--20 percentage points for intimate partner violence. Exploiting the double-list experiment design, we also demonstrate that the prevalence estimates obtained through the use of the two lists are identical in the full sample and across sub-groups and that the double-list design reduces the standard errors by approximately 40\% compared to the standard errors in the simple list design. Finally, we show that the list experiment method leads to a higher estimation of the prevalence of sensitive behaviours than the polling vote method. Conclusion The study suggests that list experiments are an effective method to improve estimation of the prevalence of sensitive health behaviours.},

Theorems 1 and 2 study the asymptotic distribution of an estimator constructed from such a sample. The key technical difficulties stem from (i) the dependence between samples and (ii) the tree structure which characterizes the dependence. The theorems allow the growth rate of the tree to exceed one and suggest that this growth rate should not be too large. To illustrate the usefulness of these results beyond their obvious use, an example shows that in certain cases the sample average is preferable to inverse probability weighting. We provide a test statistic to distinguish between these two cases.},

  abstract = {The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is a critical and widely available population health indicator. Both the MDGs and SDGs define targets for improvement in the U5MR, and the SDGs require spatial disaggregation of indicators. We estimate trends in the U5MR for Admin-1 subnational areas using 122 DHS surveys in 35 countries in Africa and assess progress toward the MDG target reductions for each subnational region and each country as a whole. In each country, direct weighted estimates of the U5MR from each survey are calculated and combined into a single estimate for each Admin-1 region across five-year periods. Our method fully accounts for the sample design of each survey. The region-time-specific estimates are smoothed using a Bayesian, space-time model that produces more precise estimates (when compared to the direct estimates) at a one-year scale that are consistent with each other in both space and time. The resulting estimated distributions of the U5MR are summarized and used to assess subnational progress toward the MDG 4 target of two-thirds reduction in the U5MR during 1990--2015. Our space-time modeling approach is tractable and can be readily applied to a large collection of sample survey data. Subnational, regional spatial heterogeneity in the levels and trends in the U5MR vary considerably across Africa. There is no generalizable pattern between spatial heterogeneity and levels or trends in the U5MR. Subnational, small-area estimates of the U5MR: (i) identify subnational regions where interventions are still necessary and those where improvement is well under way; and (ii) countries where there is very little spatial variation and others where there are important differences between subregions in both levels and trends. More work is necessary to improve both the data sources and methods necessary to adequately measure subnational progress toward the SDG child survival targets.},

The open source R package SUMMER implements a variety of methods for spatial or spatio-temporal smoothing of survey data. The emphasis is on small-area estimation. We focus primarily on indicators in a low and middle-income countries context. Our methods are particularly useful for data from Demographic Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. We build upon functions within the survey package, and use INLA for fast Bayesian computation. This paper includes a brief overview of these methods and illustrates the workflow of accessing and processing surveys, estimating subnational child mortality rates, and visualizing results with both simulated data and DHS surveys.},

This research examined the SES differentials in old age mortality in China, a developing nation. METHODS: Hazard rate models in conjunction with ordinary least squares and logistic regression analyses were used to ascertain the gross, direct, indirect, and interaction effects of SES on mortality during a 3-year period in a probability sample of 2,943 persons aged 60 years or older in Wuhan, China. RESULTS: Education, household economic well being, and urban-rural residence showed statistically significant gross effects on old age mortality. Education influenced mortality directly and indirectly. Household economic well being and urbanicity exerted indirect effects on mortality through mediating variables such as stress, social relations, and baseline health status. The mechanism through which education affected mortality differed between men and women, but SES differentials in mortality did not interact with age. DISCUSSION: SES differentials in old age mortality may be extended to a developing nation such as China. The observed gender by SES interaction effect on old age mortality has important implications for intervention. In particular. improving education among women in underdeveloped areas must remain a high priority, for policy makers in efforts to extend the life expectancy of women.},

  abstract = {It is now established that across the United States, minoritized populations have borne a disproportionate burden from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about the interaction among a county's racial/ethnic composition, its level of income inequality, political factors, and COVID-19 outcomes in the population.To quantify the association of economic inequality, racial/ethnic composition, political factors, and state health care policy with the incidence and mortality burden associated with COVID-19.This cross-sectional study used data from the 3142 counties in the 50 US states and for Washington, DC. Data on the first 200 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the first confirmed US case on January 22 to August 8, 2020, were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAFacts.org, the US Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, GitHub, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Council of State Governments, and the National Governors Association.Racial/ethnic composition was determined as percentage of the population that is Black or Hispanic; income inequality, using the Gini index; politics, political affiliation and sex of the state governor, gubernatorial term limits, and percentage of the county's population that voted Republican in 2016; and state health care policy, participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Six additional covariates were assessed.Cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for US counties during the first 200 days of the pandemic. Main measures include percentage Black and Hispanic population composition, income inequality, and a set of additional covariates.This study included 3141 of 3142 US counties. The mean Black population was 9.365\% (range, 0-86.593\%); the mean Hispanic population was 9.754\% (range, 0.648\%-96.353\%); the mean Gini ratio was 44.538 (range, 25.670-66.470); the proportion of counties within states that implemented Medicaid expansion was 0.577 (range, 0-1); the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100\,000 population was 1093.882 (range, 0-14\,019.852); and the mean number of COVID-19--related deaths per 100\,000 population was 26.173 (range, 0-413.858). A 1.0\% increase in a county's income inequality corresponded to an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.020 (95\% CI, 1.012-1.027) for COVID-19 incidence and adjusted RR of 1.030 (95\% CI, 1.012-1.047) for COVID-19 mortality. Inequality compounded the association of racial/ethnic composition through interaction, with higher income inequality raising the intercepts of the incidence curve RR by a factor of 1.041 (95\% CI, 1.031-1.051) and that of the mortality curve RR by a factor of 1.068 (95\% CI, 1.042-1.094) but slightly lowering their curvatures, especially for Hispanic composition. When state-level specificities were controlled, none of the state political factors were associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality. However, a county in a state with Medicaid expansion implemented would see the incidence rate RR decreased by a multiplicative factor of 0.678 (95\% CI, 0.501-0.918).This county-level ecological analysis suggests that COVID-19 surveillance systems should account for county-level income inequality to better understand the social patterning of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. High levels of income inequality may harm population health irrespective of racial/ethnic composition.}

We make use of the Brazilian Health Informatics Department mortality database and population censuses from 1980 to 2010. We applied demographic methods to evaluate the quality of mortality data for 137 small areas and correct for under-registration of death counts when necessary. The second part of the analysis uses linear regression models to investigate the relationship between, on the one hand, changes in death counts coverage and age profile of mortality, and on the other, changes in the reporting of ill-defined causes of death. The completeness of death counts coverage increases from about 80\% in 1980-1991 to over 95\% in 2000-2010 at the same time the percentage of ill-defined causes of deaths reduced about 53\% in the country. The analysis suggests that the government's efforts to improve data quality are proving successful, and they will allow for a better understanding of the dynamics of health and the mortality transition.},

However, the literature has put less emphasis on municipal indexes, which is the focus of this research. In this paper, we considered municipal environmental management as the adoption of environmental activities and the development of infrastructural and technical capacities in municipalities. This article aims to create a sustainable human development index with municipal data from the state of S{\~a}o Paulo in Brazil. Using information from the Municipal Human Development Index (IDHm) and the GreenBlue Municipal Program (PMVA), we applied the data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique to connect human development and environmental sustainability in 645 Brazilian municipalities. Our findings show that regions with higher human development present better DEA scores on the Sustainable Human Development Index. In contrast, regions with a low or a middle level of human development do not present significant change considering both dimensions. Moreover, our findings reveal that PMVA certification has a different and statistically significant impact on the DEA score considering certified, qualified, or not qualified regions. We found similar results for urbanized and service-oriented municipalities. Our indicator is an essential and straightforward tool for regional policymakers, helping to allocate resources and to find human development and environmental sustainability benchmarks among developing regions.},

  abstract = {Previous studies which examine the theory linking social resources to instrumental action have focused on a particular activated set of social ties in order to assess the effects of social resources on a specific action (finding a job or finding a stranger). However, the theory also implies that an individual's access to such social resources is contingent upon his/her social position as well as the nature of the social ties used. Assuming positions in the occupational structure represent resources, this paper reports a study designed to examine access to occupations through social ties. Data tend to support two major propositions in the theory. The strength of positions (as indicated by father's occupation) as well as the strength of ties (as indicated by the nature of the tie being a relative, friend or acquaintance) affect one's access to high-prestige occupations and affect the range of occupations accessed. Higher original positions and weaker ties (friends and acquaintances rather than relatives) provide better access to white-collar or more prestigious occupations, and, as a consequence, provide access to a wider range of occupations. Weaker ties provide better access to social resources than stronger ties, especially for those whose original positions are relatively low. There is also some evidence that friends, as opposed to relatives and acquaintances, may provide the widest access to different positions in the occupational structure. However, this finding is tentative since access through acquaintances may have been underestimated due to the particular measure used and to the possibility of a recall problem.},

Methods We used respondent-driven sampling to recruit a cross-sectional sample of boda-boda drivers. We collected data through audio computer-assisted self-administered interviews. Men were tested for HIV, syphilis serology using Rapid Plasma Reagin and enzyme immunoassay, and Chlamydia and gonorrhoea using urine polymerase chain reaction. Results We recruited 683 men. Median age was 26 years; 59.4\% were single. The prevalence of HIV was 7.5\% (95\% CI 5.2--10.0), of positive syphilis serology was 6.1\% (95\% CI 4.3--8.1), of Chlamydia was 1.1\% (95\% CI 0.4--2.0), and of gonorrhea was 1.2\% (95\% CI 0.1--1.2). Many men (67.8\%) had both casual and regular partners, sex with other men (8.7\%), and commercial sex (33.1\%). Factors associated with having HIV included reporting a genital ulcer (odds ratio (OR) =2.4, 95\% CI 1.4--4.4), drinking alcohol during last sex (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1--3.7), having 4--6 lifetime partners (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.0--4.8), and having one's last female partner be {$>$}24 years of age (OR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.2--6.6). Independent predictors of HIV included age {$\geq$}31 (adjusted OR (aOR) 5.8, 95\% CI 1.5--48.5), having 4--6 partners (aOR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.0--5.1), and self-report of a genital ulcer (OR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.2--4.1). Only 39.2\% of men were circumcised, and 36.9\% had been HIV tested in the past. Conclusions Male boda-boda drivers have a higher prevalence of HIV than the general population, and low frequency of preventive behaviours, such as circumcision and HIV testing. Targeted and intensified interventions for this group are warranted.},

  abstract = {In standard time-to-event or survival analysis, occurrence times of the event of interest are observed exactly or are right-censored, meaning that it is only known that the event occurred after the last observation time. There are numerous methods available for estimating the survival curve and for testing and estimation of the effects of covariates in this context. In some situations, however, the times of the events of interest may only be known to have occurred within an interval of time. In clinical trials, for example, patients are often seen at pre-scheduled visits but the event of interest may occur in between visits. These data are interval-censored. Owing to the lack of well-known statistical methodology and available software, a common ad hoc approach is to assume that the event occurred at the end (or beginning or midpoint) of each interval, and then apply methods for standard time-to-event data. However, this approach can lead to invalid inferences, and in particular will tend to underestimate the standard errors of the estimated parameters. The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate and compare available methods which correctly treat the data as being interval-censored. It is not meant to be a full review of all existing methods, but only those which are available in standard statistical software, or which can be easily programmed. All approaches will be illustrated on two data sets and compared with methods which ignore the interval-censored nature of the data. We hope this tutorial will allow those familiar with the application of standard survival analysis techniques the option of applying appropriate methods when presented with interval-censored data. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This article reviews the debate between design-based and model-based inference. The basic features of the two approaches are illustrated using the case of inference about the mean from stratified random samples. Strengths and weakness of design-based and model-based inference for surveys are discussed. It is suggested that models that take into account the sample design and make weak parametric assumptions can produce reliable and efficient inferences in surveys settings. These ideas are illustrated using the problem of inference from unequal probability samples. A model-based regression analysis that leads to a combination of design-based and model-based weighting is described.},

  abstract = {Post-stratification is a common technique in survey analysis for incorporating population distributions of variables into survey estimates. The basic technique divides the sample into post-strata, and computes a post-stratification weight w  ih  = rP  h /r  h  for each sample case in post-stratum h, where r  h  is the number of survey respondents in post-stratum h, P  h  is the population proportion from a census, and r is the respondent sample size. Survey estimates, such as functions of means and totals, then weight cases by w  h . Variants and extensions of the method include truncation of the weights to avoid excessive variability and raking to a set of two or more univariate marginal distributions. Literature on post-stratification is limited and has mainly taken the randomization (or design-based) perspective, where inference is based on the sampling distribution with population values held fixed. This article develops Bayesian model-based theory for the method. A basic normal post-stratification model is introduced which yields the post-stratified mean as the posterior mean, and a posterior variance that incorporates adjustments for estimating variances. Modifications are then proposed for small sample inference, based on (a) changing the Jeffreys prior for the post-stratum parameters to borrow strength across post-strata, and (b) ignoring partial information about the post-strata. In particular, practical rules for collapsing post-strata to reduce posterior variance are developed and compared with frequentist approaches. Methods for two post-stratifying variables are also considered. Raking sample counts and respondent counts is shown to provide approximate Bayesian inferences when the margins of the two post-stratifiers are available but their joint distribution is not. When the joint distribution is available, raking effectively ignores the information it contains, and hence can be compared with other techniques that ignore information such as collapsing. For inference about means, it is suggested that raking is most appropriate when post-stratum means have an additive or near-additive structure, whereas collapsing is indicated when interactions are present.}

  abstract = {The lack of social integration has predicted coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in prospective observational studies; however, the biologic mechanisms by which this may occur are not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether social integration is associated with inflammatory risk factors for coronary heart disease, specifically C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6. The study participants (aged 70 to 79 years; 380 men and 425 women) were from the MacArthur Successful Aging Study, a longitudinal study of 3 community-based cohorts in the United States of older adults with relatively high physical and cognitive functioning at baseline (1988 to 1989). The plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 and CRP were assessed using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses were performed. Multivariate adjusted analyses indicated that social integration was significantly inversely associated with CRP concentration in men after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, other major or chronic conditions, physical functioning, socioeconomic status, and depression (odds ratio 2.23, 95\% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.76, for elevated CRP [{$>$}3.19 mg/L] in the least socially integrated quartile vs the most socially integrated quartile). No significant associations were found between social integration and interleukin-6 in men or either inflammatory marker in women. In conclusion, social integration was negatively associated with the plasma CRP concentration in men. These findings suggest a potential biologic mechanism for the observed associations between social integration and coronary heart disease in prospective studies. Differences may exist between women and men in the biologic pathways associated with social integration.},

We address this well-known inefficiency problem by presenting a unified Bayesian framework which combines indirect measures with prior in- formation. Specifying informed priors amounts to a principled combination of information which increases the efficiency of model estimates. This framework generalizes a whole range of different design and modeling approaches for list experiments, such as the inclusion of direct items, auxiliary information, the double list experiment and the combination of list experiments with other indirect questioning techniques. As we demonstrate in several real-world examples from political science, our Bayesian approach not only improves the efficiency and utility but also changes the substantive implications drawn from list experiments. This way, it contributes to a more accurate understanding of sensitive preferences and behaviors of political relevance.},

We estimate its distributional parameters for a large, representative sample of the general population of Spain, explore its variation across social groups as well as its implications for social support availability. We designed a survey instrument based on the Network Scale-Up Method and implemented it in a national survey in Spain. Our results suggest that Spaniards have approximately 536 acquaintances, with a large inter-individual variation, comparable to the estimates reported for the American population. Acquaintanceship volume varies with gender, age, education, and income. These differences are partially related to the unequal participation of social groups in voluntary associations, confirming the civic value of such associations, and in employment. Even with similar core network size, acquaintanceship volume increases the likelihood of having adequate social support available, suggesting that broader acquaintanceship networks also structure individual outcomes.},

Using new data from Kisumu, Kenya, and controlling for selection into marriage, we find that marriage significantly increases employment levels and incomes in our sample of migrants. At the same time, marriage increases the remittances that migrants send to the extended family, consistent with the view that the benefits of the network come with additional social obligations. These obligations appear to be borne disproportionately by high-ability individuals, who consequently defer marriage. The negative selection into marriage that we uncover has consequences for the future viability of the urban networks, with implications for long-term growth and distribution in this economy.}

We have, however, little individual-level evidence that these ``hearts and minds'' programs actually influence combatant support. We address this problem by conducting a factorial randomized control trial of two common interventions---vocational training and cash transfers---on combatant support among 2,597 at-risk youth in Kandahar, Afghanistan. We find that training only improved economic livelihoods modestly and had little effect on combatant support. Cash failed to lift incomes, producing a boom-and-bust dynamic in which pro-government sentiment initially spiked and then quickly reversed itself, leaving a residue of increased Taliban support. Conditional on training, cash failed to improve beneficiaries' livelihoods but did increase support for the Afghan government for at least eight months after the intervention. These findings suggest that aid affects attitudes by providing information about government resolve and competence rather than by improving economic livelihoods.},

Yet despite its essential role in civil war dynamics, the act of informing is still poorly understood, due mostly to the classified nature of informant ``tips.'' As an alternative research strategy, we use an original 2,700 respondent survey experiment in 100 villages to examine attitudes toward the Guardians of Peace program, a widespread campaign by the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan to recruit local informants. We find that coethnic bias---the systematic tendency to favor cooperation with coethnics---shapes attitudes about informing and beliefs about retaliation, especially among Tajik respondents. This bias persists even after adjusting for additional explanations and potential confounding variables, suggesting that identity considerations such as coethnicity may influence attitudes toward high-risk behavior in wartime settings.}

We use endorsement experiments to indirectly elicit truthful answers to sensitive questions about support for different combatants. We demonstrate that civilian attitudes are asymmetric in nature. Harm inflicted by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is met with reduced support for ISAF and increased support for the Taliban, but Taliban-inflicted harm does not translate into greater ISAF support. We combine a multistage sampling design with hierarchical modeling to estimate ISAF and Taliban support at the individual, village, and district levels, permitting a more fine-grained analysis of wartime attitudes than previously possible.},

Estimates of size and HIV prevalence of these populations allow the total number of HIV infected people in a country or region to be estimated. Major changes in the software focus on the move away from short term projections and towards developing an epidemiological curve that more accurately represents the change in prevalence of HIV over time. The software continues to provide an output file for use in the Spectrum software so as to estimate the demographic impact of HIV infection at country level.},

We measure social interaction through the cross-sibling influences on fertility. Continuous-time hazard models are estimated separately for women's first and second births. In addition to individual socioeconomic variables, demographic variables, and an unobserved factor specific to each sibling pair, siblings' birth events and their timing enter as time-varying covariates. We use data from longitudinal population-wide Norwegian administrative registers. The data cover more than 110,000 sibling pairs and include the siblings' fertility, education, income, and marital histories. Our results indicate that cross-sibling influences are relatively strong for the respondents' first births but weak for the second parity transition.},

We studied the possible causes of this remarkable development. Mortality data by age, gender and cause of death were analyzed using life table methods and age-period-cohort modeling. Trends in determinants of mortality (including health care delivery) were compared with trends in mortality. Two-thirds of the increase in life expectancy at birth since 2002 were due to declines in mortality among those aged 65 and over. Declines in mortality reflected a period rather than a cohort effect, and were seen for a wide range of causes of death. Favorable changes in mortality determinants coinciding with the acceleration of mortality decline were mainly seen within the health care system. Health care expenditure rose rapidly after 2001, and was accompanied by a sharp rise of specialist visits, drug prescriptions, hospital admissions and surgical procedures among the elderly. A decline of deaths following non-treatment decisions suggests a change towards more active treatment of elderly patients. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the sharp upturn of life expectancy in the Netherlands was at least partly due to a sharp increase in health care for the elderly, and has been facilitated by a relaxation of budgetary constraints in the health care system.},

We revisited a possible explanation suggested by Granovetter's classic threshold model: collective behavior can unexpectedly fail, despite a group's strong interest in the outcome, because of the sensitivity of cascades to small random perturbations in group composition and the distribution of thresholds. Paradoxically, we found that a small amount of randomness in individual behavior can make collective behavior less sensitive to these perturbations and therefore more predictable. We also examined conditions in which collective behavior unexpectedly succeeds despite the group's weak interest in the outcome. In groups with an otherwise intractable start-up problem, individual randomness can lead to spontaneous instigation, making outcomes more sensitive to the strength of collective interests and therefore more predictable. These effects of chance behavior become much more pronounced as group size increases. Although randomness is often assumed to be a theoretically unimportant residual category, our findings point to the need to bring individual idiosyncrasy back into the study of collective behavior.},

  abstract = {Introduction The results of the network scale-up (NSU) method in estimating the size of key populations for HIV might be biased if the recruited subjects are not fully informed of the risky behaviors of people in their networks (low visibility), or key populations have a smaller social network (low popularity). We aimed to measure such biases in the size estimation of people who inject drugs (PWIDs), and female sex workers (FSWs) in Iran. Methods We interviewed 163 male PWIDs, 76 FSWs (known as egos) and 600 subjects from the general population. We selected twenty first-names (ten males and ten females) and asked the study subjects separately how many people they knew with one of these names (known as alters). Visibility Factor (VF) was defined as the percentage of FSW or PWID alters that were aware of their behavior. In addition, the popularity factor (PF) was calculated by dividing the number of alters reported by FSWs and PWIDs into that of the general population. The 95\% uncertainty intervals (UI) were calculated using bootstrap technique. Results The VF was estimated at 54\% (95\% UI: 52\%--56\%) for PWID and 45\% (95\% UI: 42\%-- 48\%) for FSW. The VF among the peer alters was significantly higher than non-peer ones. The PF for PWID and FSW was 69\% (95\% UI: 66\%--73\%) and 77\% (95\% UI: 72\%--83\%), respectively. The cross-validation and name splitting analysis showed that our estimates were not influenced by any single name. Conclusions Both correction factors, particularly VF were far from one, and NSU results without correction, could lead to up to 4 times underestimation of the sizes. Therefore, applying these coefficients is necessary in NSU projects.}

Studies collectively recruited 32,298 participants between 2003 and 2007; 53\% of studies were conducted among injecting drug users, which generally had faster recruitment compared with studies among sex workers. All but 13 studies reached {$>\neq$}90\% of their intended sample size, and six studies failed to reach equilibrium for key variables.

Alternatively, we suggest that openness to foreign investment has differential effects on corruption even within the same country and under the same domestic institutions over time. We argue that foreign firms use bribes to enter protected industries in search of rents, and therefore we expect variation in bribe propensity across sectors according to expected profitability. We test this effect using a list experiment embedded in three waves of a nationally representative survey of 20,000 foreign and domestic businesses in Vietnam, finding that the effect of economic openness on the probability to engage in bribes is conditional on policies that restrict investment.},

I surveyed a random sample of the US adult population over the Web and manipulated the order in which respondents saw the response options. I then assessed whether primacy effects were moderated by the overall length of time respondents took to complete the questionnaires. I found that low-education respondents who filled out the questionnaire most quickly were most prone to primacy effects when completing items with unipolar rating scales. These results have important implications for various aspects of Web survey methodology including panel management, human--computer interaction, and response order randomization.},

Such data arise by asking respondents how many people they know in a specific group (e.g. people named Michael, intravenous drug users). The Network Scale up Method (NSUM) is a tool for producing population size estimates using these indirect measures of respondents' networks. Killworth et al (1998a,b) proposed maximum likelihood estimators of population size for a fixed effects model in which respondents' degrees or personal network sizes are treated as fixed. We extend this by treating personal network sizes as random effects, yielding principled statements of uncertainty. This allows us to generalize the model to account for variation in people's propensity to know people in particular subgroups (barrier effects), such as their tendency to know people like themselves,as well as their lack of awareness of or reluctance to acknowledge their contacts' group memberships (transmission bias). NSUM estimates also suffer from recall bias, in which respondents tend to underestimate the number of members of larger groups that they know, and conversely for smaller groups. We propose a data-driven adjustment method to deal with this. Our methods perform well in simulation studies, generating improved estimates and calibrated uncertainty intervals, as well as in back estimates of real sample data. We apply them to data from a study of HIV/AIDS prevalence in Curitiba, Brazil. Our results show that when transmission bias is present, external information about its likely extent can greatly improve the estimates.},

We find that mobile phones are instrumental to mass mobilization during economic downturns, when reasons for grievance emerge and the cost of participation falls. Estimated effects are if anything larger once we use an instrumental variable approach that relies on differential trends in coverage across areas with different incidence of lightning strikes. The results are in line with insights from a network model with imperfect information and strategic complementarities in protest provision. Mobile phones make individuals more responsive to both changes in economic conditions - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced information - and to their neighbors' participation - a mechanism that we ascribe to enhanced coordination. Empirically both effects are at play, highlighting the channels through which digital ICT can alleviate the collective action problem.},

They account for the stratification of contacts for the age of individuals and, in some cases, the context of their interactions. However, age and context are not the only factors shaping contact structures and affecting the spreading of infectious diseases. Socio-economic status (SES) variables such as wealth, ethnicity, and education play a major role as well. Here, we introduce generalized contact matrices capable of stratifying contacts across any number of dimensions including any SES variable. We derive an analytical expression for the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease unfolding on a population characterized by such generalized contact matrices. Our results, on both synthetic and real data, show that disregarding higher levels of stratification might lead to the under-estimation of the reproductive number and to a mis-estimation of the global epidemic dynamics. Furthermore, including generalized contact matrices allows for more expressive epidemic models able to capture heterogeneities in behaviours such as different levels of adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions across different groups. Overall, our work contributes to the literature attempting to bring socioeconomic, as well as other dimensions, to the forefront of epidemic modeling. Tackling this issue is crucial for developing more precise descriptions of epidemics, and thus to design better strategies to contain them.},

We use matched data from six sources, originally analyzed by the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2003, together with a new large dataset, originally published in 2006 by the Peruvian government. We deal with missing stratification labels by developing a general framework and estimation methods based on MCMC sampling for jointly fitting generic Bayesian Capture-Recapture models and the missing labels. Through a detailed exploration driven by domain-knowledge, modeling and refining, with special precautions to avoid cherry-picking of results, we arrive to a conservative posterior estimate of 58,234 (CI95\% = [56,741, 61,289]), and a more liberal estimate of 65,958 (CI95\% = [61,462, 75,387]) fatal victims. We also determine that the Shining Path guerrillas killed more people than the Peruvian armed forces. We additionally explore and discuss estimates based on log-linear modeling and multiple-imputation.

  abstract = {Name generators used to measure egocentric networks are complex survey questions that make substantial demands on respondents and interviewers alike. They are therefore vulnerable to interviewer effects, which arise when interviewers administer questions differently in ways that affect responses-in this case, the number of names elicited. Van Tilburg [Sociol. Methods Res. 26 (1998) 300] found significant interviewer effects on network size in a study of elderly Dutch respondents; that study included an instrument with seven name generators, the complexity of which may have accentuated interviewer effects. This article examines a simpler single-generator elicitation instrument administered in the 1998 General Social Survey (GSS). Interviewer effects on network size as measured by this instrument are smaller than those found by Van Tilburg, but only modestly so. Variations in the network size of respondents within interviewer caseloads (estimated using a single-item '' global'' measure of network size and an independent sample of respondents) reduce but do not explain interviewer effects on the name generator measure. Interviewer differences remain significant after further controls for between-interviewer differences in the sociodemographic composition of respondent pools. Further insight into the sources of interviewer effects may be obtained via monitoring respondent--interviewer interactions for differences in how name generators are administered.},

  abstract = {Contemporary youth conflict often plays out through social media like Facebook and Twitter. `Drama' is an emergent concept describing performative, interpersonal conflict that takes place in front of an active, engaged audience, often on social media. Using ethnographic data, this paper examines how American teenagers conceptualize the term drama; the relationship between drama and social media; and the implications drama has for understanding contemporary teenage conflict. The emic use of drama distances teens from practices conceptualized by adults as bullying or relational aggression, while acknowledging the role of the audience in social media interactions. Drama also serves to reinforce the conventional gendered norms of high school, perpetrating the systemic undervaluing of feminine subjects and re-inscribing heteronormativity. Understanding how drama operates helps illuminate how widespread use of social media among teenagers has altered dynamics of aggression and conflict.}

Orphanhood prevalence derived from UNAIDS mortality estimates was compared with survey and census reports on the survival of children's parents.Age-specific mortality rates for adults aged 15-59 years were calculated from Demographic and Health Surveys and deaths reported in censuses or vital registration, adjusted for underreporting, whenever possible. Proportions of orphans were extracted from censuses and surveys for children aged 5-9 years.UNAIDS estimates were significantly higher than sibling mortality estimates, except among men in countries with very high HIV prevalence. There was a better agreement between rates based on household deaths or vital registration and model outputs. Sex ratios (M/F) of adult mortality were lower in UNAIDS estimates. The modelled orphan prevalence was significantly higher than in surveys and censuses, again with the exception of paternal orphans in countries with very high HIV prevalence. Ratios of paternal-to-maternal orphans were lower in the UNAIDS model than surveys and censuses. Among women, increases in mortality due to AIDS were more concentrated in the age range 25-50 years in model outputs, as compared with empirical estimates.Discrepancies in levels, sex ratios and age patterns of adult mortality between empirical and UNAIDS estimates call for additional data quality assessments and improvements in estimation methods.},

Puisque les niveaux d'instruction sont tr{\`e}s corr{\'e}l{\'e}s au sein des familles, les niveaux atteints par les fem\-mes enqu{\^e}t{\'e}es peuvent servir {\`a} approximer le niveau d'instruction de leurs s{\oe}urs.

Abstract In high-income countries, there is extensive evidence showing that higher levels of educational attainment, higher income and higher occupational classes are correlated with lower mortality rates among adults. In low- and middle-income countries, far less is known on mortality differentials in this age group due to the lack of information on the socio-economic characteristics of the deceased. In this paper, we evaluate whether survey reports on the survival of sisters can help to fill this gap. We find that levels of educational attainment are correlated within families, and therefore characteristics of the deceased can be inferred from levels attained by their sisters responding to the survey. Because estimates based on sibling survival histories have large confidence intervals, we pool all Demographic and Health Surveys together and apply a generalized linear mixed-effects model to capture mortality differentials. In most surveys, higher education is indeed associated with lower risks of dying, especially in urban areas, but reverse gradients are observed in several countries experiencing generalized HIV epidemics. There is limited support for the hypothesis that women with less education are disproportionately omitting to report some deaths. Instead, we argue that sibling histories truly reflect the complexity of the relationship between adult mortality and education, especially in countries affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Overall, the sibling approach offers new avenues for measuring inequalities in adult mortality in low- and middle-income countries.},

We evaluate age and date reporting errors in sibling histories collected during a validation study in the Niakhar Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Senegal). Participants were randomly assigned to either the Demographic and Health Survey questionnaire or a questionnaire incorporating an event history calendar, recall cues, and increased probing strategies. We linked 60--62 per cent of survey reports of siblings to the reference database using manual and probabilistic approaches. Both questionnaires showed high sensitivity ({$>$}96 per cent) and specificity ({$>$}97 per cent) in recording siblings' vital status. Respondents underestimated the age of living siblings, and age at and time since death of deceased siblings. These reporting errors introduced downward biases in mortality estimates. The revised questionnaire improved reporting of age of living siblings but not of age at or timing of deaths.},

Orthogonal and oblique rotations produce pattern matrices consistent with the postulated dimensional structure. Based on the factor analyses and other information, one index was chosen to represent each of the five dimensions, and these selections were confirmed with a principal components analysis. The paper recommends adopting these indices as standard indicators in future studies of segregation.},

Beginning with a stable population of 10,000 people, we project ahead 50 years under three different assumptions: no international migration; constant probabilities of in- and out-migration, and dynamic schedules of out- and in-migration that change as migratory experience accumulates. This exercise represents an attempt to model the self-feeding character of international migration noted by prior observers and theorists. Our model quantifies the mechanisms of cumulative causation predicted by social capital theory and illustrates the shortcomings of standard projection methodologies. The failure to model dynamically changing migration schedules yields a 5\% overstatement of the projected size of the Mexican population after 50 years, an 11\% understatement of the total number of U.S. migrants, a 15\% understatement of the prevalence of U.S. migratory experience in the Mexican population, and an 85\% understatement of the size of the Mexican population living in the United States.}

We examine all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease, lung cancer, and unpreventable cancers. Findings reveal that temporal reductions in black and white men's and women's mortality rates were driven entirely by cohort changes in mortality. Findings also demonstrate that disparate cohort effects between education groups widened the education gap in all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease and lung cancer across this time period. Educational disparities in mortality risk from unpreventable cancers, however, did not change. This research uncovers widening educational differences in adult mortality and demonstrates that a cohort perspective provides valuable insights for understanding recent temporal changes in U.S. mortality risk.},

First names were used as a cue to elicit a sample of 14 alters from 712 respondents through a telephone interview. Network characteristics for each respondent were calculated as averages and proportions across the 14 alters. These were compared to other studies using more specialized network generators. Our method produced results which are logically consistent with those expected from a generator that elicits a sample from the total rather than a specialized subset of the total network. The proportions of kin relations, average tie strength and frequency of contacts are found to be lower than network generators designed to elicit networks of social support. Given our conclusion that the sample is representative of the total network, we examine the varying characteristics of respondents and their networks based on the domination of a particular relation type in their network. This analysis provides answers to such questions as 'What characteristics of respondents account for the proportion of family relations in their network?' and 'What are the similarities between respondents whose networks are made up of mostly work-related relations?'}

Respondents evaluated the communication between 990 alter pairs. The methods were (1) dropping alters from the end of the free-list, (2) randomly dropping alters, (3) randomly dropping links, and (4) predicting ties based on transitivity. For some measures network structure is captured with samples of less than 20 alters; other measures are less consistent.

Building on the scale-up method of Killworth et al. (1998b) and other previous attempts to estimate individual network size, we propose a latent non-random mixing model which resolves three known problems with previous approaches. As a byproduct, our method also provides estimates of the rate of social mixing between population groups. We demonstrate the model using a sample of 1,370 adults originally collected by McCarty et al. (2001). Based on insights developed during the statistical modeling, we conclude by offering practical guidelines for the design of future surveys to estimate social network size. Most importantly, we show that if the first names asked about are chosen properly, the estimates from the simple scale-up model enjoy the same bias-reduction as the estimates from our more complex latent nonrandom mixing model.},

  abstract = {The sampling frame in most social science surveys excludes members                                     of certain groups, known as hard-to-reach groups. These                                     groups, or subpopulations, may be difficult to access (the                                     homeless, e.g.), camouflaged by stigma (individuals with                                     HIV/AIDS), or both (commercial sex workers). Even basic                                     demographic information about these groups is typically unknown,                                     especially in many developing nations. We present statistical                                     models which leverage social network structure to estimate                                     demographic characteristics of these subpopulations using                                     Aggregated relational data (ARD), or questions of the form ``How                                     many X's do you know?'' Unlike other network-based techniques for                                     reaching these groups, ARD require no special sampling strategy                                     and are easily incorporated into standard surveys. ARD also do                                     not require respondents to reveal their own group membership. We                                     propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the                                     demographic characteristics of hard-to-reach groups, or                                           latent demographic profiles, using ARD. We propose                                     two estimation techniques. First, we propose a Markov-chain                                     Monte Carlo algorithm for existing data or cases where the full                                     posterior distribution is of interest. For cases when new data                                     can be collected, we propose guidelines and, based on these                                     guidelines, propose a simple estimate motivated by a missing                                     data approach. Using data from McCarty et al. [Human                                           Organization                                     60 (2001) 28--39], we estimate the age and gender profiles                                     of six hard-to-reach groups, such as individuals who have HIV,                                     women who were raped, and homeless persons. We also evaluate our                                     simple estimates using simulation studies.},

The network scale-up method works with questions that are known as aggregated relational data (ARD). These questions take the form ``How many Xs do you know?'' That is, ARD are count data consisting of the number of connections between a respondent and individuals with a specific characteristic. Critically, ARD do not involve observing any links in the network and are collected using standard probability sampling techniques. The main focus of this chapter is estimating the size of a group of individuals using ARD and the network scale-up method. As the name implies, the method uses information for survey respondents' social networks to ``scale up'' to an entire population.},

One strategy for learning about these groups, or subpopulations, involves reaching hard-to-reach group members through their social network. In this paper we compare the efficiency of two common methods for subpopulation size estimation using data from standard surveys. These designs are examples of mental link tracing designs. These designs begin with a randomly sampled set of network members (nodes) and then reach other nodes indirectly through questions asked to the sampled nodes. Mental link tracing designs cost significantly less than traditional link tracing designs, yet introduce additional sources of potential bias. We examine the influence of one such source of bias using simulation studies. We then demonstrate our findings using data from the General Social Survey collected in 2004 and 2006. Additionally, we provide survey design suggestions for future surveys incorporating such designs.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the range of policies that might be used to support fertility rates at a moderate level, that is, around an average of 1.7-1.9 births per woman. The paper argues that in selecting from the range of policy options, consideration must be given to the existing social-institutional framework in the particular country. In other words, there can be no single cross-national model for success. Each country must seek its own institutionally appropriate approach. Also, each country must deal with the realities of its own political economy. Strategies will not be accepted if they are not based upon a social consensus. In addition, as far as possible, policies to support fertility should be based upon a theory or theories as to why fertility has fallen to low levels in a particular setting. Given that fertility-support policies are likely to be expensive in one way or another, some understanding of the nature of low fertility will provide greater efficiency in policy implementation. The paper reviews several possible general theories relating to low fertility. Finally, it is argued that countries should have some notion about what it is that they are aiming to achieve. Inevitably, demographic sustainability (at least zero population growth) is an ultimate aim for all countries. The question is how far into the future is \&\#8220;ultimate\&\#8221;? Or expressed differently, how much of a decline in the size of the population or the labour force is the country willing to sustain before demographic sustainability is achieved? The example of Italy is used to illustrate this point.},

  abstract = {Background: Estimates of the total number of prevalent HIV infections attributable to the major routes of infection make an important contribution to public health policy, as they are used for planning services. Methods: In the UK, estimates were derived through the ``direct method'' which estimated the total number of diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infections in the population. The direct method has been improved over a number of years since first used in 1994, as further data became available such as the inclusion of newly available behavioural survey data both from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal 2000) and community surveys of men who have sex with men (MSM). These data were used to re-estimate numbers of people unaware of their infection and provided ethnic breakdowns within behavioural categories. The total population was divided into 10 mutually exclusive behavioural categories relevant to HIV risk in the UK---for example, MSM and injecting drug users. Estimates of the population size within each group were derived from Natsal 2000 and National Statistics mid-year population estimates. The total number of undiagnosed HIV infections was calculated by multiplying the undiagnosed HIV prevalence for each group, derived from the Unlinked Anonymous HIV Prevalence Monitoring Programme surveys (UAPMP), by the population size. These estimates were then added to the prevalent diagnosed HIV infections within each group derived from the national census of diagnosed HIV infections, the Survey of Prevalent HIV Infections Diagnosed (SOPHID). The estimates were then adjusted to include all adults in the UK. Because undiagnosed HIV prevalence estimates were not available for each of the behavioural categories, the UAPMP prevalence estimates were adjusted using available data to provide the best estimates for each group. Results: It is estimated that 53 000 individuals are infected with HIV in the UK in 2003, of whom 27\% were unaware of their infection. Of the total of 53 000, an estimated 26 000 were among heterosexually infected and 24 500 among MSM. Conclusion: The direct method uses an explicit framework and data from different components of the HIV surveillance system to estimate HIV prevalence in the UK, allowing for a comprehensive picture of the epidemic.},

By the close of 2021, however, Africa remained one of the least affected regions in the world, leading commentators to speculate about a so-called ``Africa paradox''. This review evaluates current research and data to establish the burden of COVID-19 infections and mortality in the African region. Despite claims that African countries were spared from COVID-19 infection, there is now considerable serological evidence confirming that people in African countries ultimately experienced levels of SARS-CoV2 infection comparable to or more than people in other global regions. Additionally, multiple measures demonstrate substantial impacts of COVID-19 on mortality in specific African countries where mortality and/or seroprevalence data are available. The gaps between recorded cases and seroprevalence are large and increased over the course of the pandemic. Researchers also observe significant gaps between recorded COVID-19 deaths and other measures of mortality, attributable to weak civil and vital registration systems, limited health care resources, and higher mortality at younger ages. Our findings reinforce the need for more equitable global distribution of health care resources and expanded disease and mortality surveillance across the continent.},

List randomization is a technique that has been used in a number of other social science applications to elicit sensitive information. We trial this technique by adding it to surveys conducted in Ethiopia, Mexico, Morocco and the Philippines. We show how, in principle, this can be used both to give an estimate of the overall rate of illegal migration in the population being surveyed, as well as to determine illegal migration rates for subgroups such as more or less educated households. Our results suggest that there is some useful information in this method: we find higher rates of illegal migration in countries where illegal migration is thought to be more prevalent, and households who say they have a migrant are more likely to report having an illegal migrant. Nevertheless, some of our other findings also suggest some possible inconsistencies or noise in the conclusions obtained using this method, so we suggest directions for future attempts to implement this approach in migration surveys.}

This paper shows both theoretically and empirically that wealth has a nonlinear effect on migration, and then examines the empirical evidence for an inverse U-shaped relationship between emigration and inequality in rural sending communities in Mexico. After instrumenting, we find that the overall impact of migration is to reduce inequality across communities with relatively high levels of past migration.

We tested whether such data could be collected during household surveys periodically conducted in most African countries. Methods: We added HIV questions to the module on adult and maternal mortality used in Demographic and Health Surveys. We conducted a validation study of the data generated by these questions in northern Malawi. We randomly assigned men and women aged 15-59 years old to a face-to-face interview or audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). We compared survey reports of adult deaths to prospective data on mortality and HIV collected by the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of survey data in recording the HIV status of deceased siblings of respondents. We adjusted for partial verification bias using multiple imputations. Results: We interviewed 535 participants, who reported 885 deaths at ages 15 and older. The added HIV questions yielded largely complete data on the HIV status of deceased siblings of respondents, particularly those who died recently. The adjusted sensitivity of survey data on HIV status of the deceased was high in both study groups (0.78-0.82). There were few false positive reports of the HIV status of deceased siblings (specificity = 0.96-0.98). ACASI did not improve the accuracy of survey data, but it required more time to collect mortality reports. Asking the HIV questions only took 0.4 minute (approximately 25 seconds) per deceased sibling in face-to-face interviews.   Conclusions: Adding HIV questions to mortality questionnaires used in household surveys yields accurate data on the HIV status of deceased adults. These new data could aid in tracking progress towards global HIV elimination targets.},

  abstract = {Background Patterns of person-to-person contacts relevant for infectious diseases transmission are still poorly quantified in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where socio-demographic structures and behavioral attitudes are expected to be different from those of more developed countries. Methods and Findings We conducted a diary-based survey on daily contacts and time-use of individuals of different ages in one rural and one peri-urban site of Manicaland, Zimbabwe. A total of 2,490 diaries were collected and used to derive age-structured contact matrices, to analyze time spent by individuals in different settings, and to identify the key determinants of individuals' mixing patterns. Overall 10.8 contacts per person/day were reported, with a significant difference between the peri-urban and the rural site (11.6 versus 10.2). A strong age-assortativeness characterized contacts of school-aged children, whereas the high proportion of extended families and the young population age-structure led to a significant intergenerational mixing at older ages. Individuals spent on average 67\% of daytime at home, 2\% at work, and 9\% at school. Active participation in school and work resulted the key drivers of the number of contacts and, similarly, household size, class size, and time spent at work influenced the number of home, school, and work contacts, respectively. We found that the heterogeneous nature of home contacts is critical for an epidemic transmission chain. In particular, our results suggest that, during the initial phase of an epidemic, about 50\% of infections are expected to occur among individuals younger than 12 years and less than 20\% among individuals older than 35 years. Conclusions With the current work, we have gathered data and information on the ways through which individuals in SSA interact, and on the factors that mostly facilitate this interaction. Monitoring these processes is critical to realistically predict the effects of interventions on infectious diseases dynamics.},

Contrary to expectation, we find that leaders are similarly receptive to citizen suggestions obtained through either formal institutions or the Internet unless they perceive antagonism between the state and citizens, in which case receptivity to input from the Internet declines, while receptivity to formal institutions remains unchanged.

  abstract = {Estimating population size is an important task for epidemiologists and ecologists alike, for purposes of resource planning and policy making.  One method is the "multiplier method" which uses information about a binary trait to infer the size of a population.  The first half of this thesis presents a likelihood-based estimator which generalizes the multiplier method to accommodate multiple traits as well as any number of categories (strata) in a trait.  The asymptotic variance of this likelihood-based estimator is obtained through the Fisher Information and its behaviour with varying study designs is determined.  The statistical advantage of using additional traits is most pronounced when the traits are uncorrelated and of low prevalence, and diminishes when the number of traits becomes large.  The use of highly stratified traits however, does not appear to provide much advantage over using binary traits.   Finally, a Bayesian implementation of this method is applied to both simulated data and real data pertaining to an injection-drug user population.  The second half of this thesis is a first systematic approach to quantifying the uncertainty in marginal count data that is an essential component of the multiplier method.  A migration model that captures the stochastic mechanism giving rise to uncertainty is proposed.  The migration model is applied, in conjunction with the multi-trait multiplier method, to real-data from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control.},

The authors investigate the strategies proxy-reporters use to answer such questions and how close they come to what the target respondents themselves answer. They find that as the extent to which a couple talks to each other or participates in an activity together increases, proxy-reporters tend to use more specific information about the target respondent, and the convergence between self- and proxy-reports tends to increase. Furthermore, as the extent of participation/discussion increases, the strategies used to arrive at self- and proxy-reports become more similar. Implications for improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of survey research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many people living in low- and middle-income countries are not covered by civil registration and vital statistics systems. Consequently, a wide variety of other types of data, including many household sample surveys, are used to estimate health and population indicators. In this paper we combine data from sample surveys and demographic surveillance systems to produce small area estimates of child mortality through time. Small area estimates are necessary to understand geographical heterogeneity in health indicators when full-coverage vital statistics are not available. For this endeavor spatio-temporal smoothing is beneficial to alleviate problems of data sparsity. The use of conventional hierarchical models requires careful thought since the survey weights may need to be considered to alleviate bias due to nonrandom sampling and nonresponse. The application that motivated this work is an estimation of child mortality rates in five-year time intervals in regions of Tanzania. Data come from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted over the period 1991--2010 and two demographic surveillance system sites. We derive a variance estimator of under five years child mortality that accounts for the complex survey weighting. For our application, the hierarchical models we consider include random effects for area, time and survey and we compare models using a variety of measures including the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO). The method we propose is implemented via the fast and accurate integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).},

We evaluate the contribution to the spread of HIV of China's regime of heterosexual relations, of the structure of heterosexual networks, and of the attributes of key population groups with simulations driven by data from a cross-sectional survey of egocentric sexual networks of the general population of Shanghai and from a concurrent respondent-driven sample of FSWs. We find that the heterosexual network generated by our empirically calibrated simulations has low levels of partner change, strong constraints on partner selection by age and education, and a very small connected core, mainly comprising FSWs and their clients and characterized by a fragile transmission structure. This network has a small HIV epidemic potential but is compatible with the transmission of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as syphilis, which are less susceptible to structural breaks in transmission of infection. Our results suggest that policies that force commercial sex underground could have an adverse effect on the spread of HIV and other STIs.},

This phenomenon is particularly pronounced among women, who are far ahead of men in survival rates. Thus, to project the future of life expectancy, this study focuses on trends in female life expectancy at ages 65 and older. Four countries are selected for this analysis: the United States, Netherlands, France, and Japan. It is particularly interesting to understand why American and Dutch trends in female old-age mortality have been diverging from those in France and Japan for two decades. It is shown here that most of the divergence derives from the fact that decline in cardiovascular mortality is more and more offset by increases in other causes of death in the United States and the Netherlands, while the other two countries are more successful in reducing mortality from all causes at increasingly older ages. This latter phenomenon could represent a new stage of the health transition.}

Women\&\#8217;s life expectancy at birth increased by 14.6 years from 1950 to 2005, and men\&\#8217;s by 13.3 years. In the last twenty years, the gap in life expectancy between the sexes has stopped widening and begun to close. This is mainly due to an acceleration in the improvement among men, but some slowing in improvement among women under 60 is also perceptible. At later ages, on the other hand, improvement continued to be more rapid for women than men. Although cancer mortality is falling for both men and women, cancer is now the leading cause of death, overtaking cardio-vascular disease, for which mortality has considerably reduced. Among the oldest groups, the exceptionally high mortality due to the 2003 heat wave caused only a brief interruption in the positive trend brought about mainly by lower cardio-vascular mortality. Future improvement will depend on success in the control of cancer and neuro-degenerative disease., Independientemente del sexo y de la edad, la esperanza de vida no ha dejado casi de aumentar en Francia desde principios de los a\&\#241;os 50. Al nacer las mujeres ya han ganado 14,6\&\#160;a\&\#241;os de esperanza de vida entre 1950 y 2005 y los hombres 13,3 a\&\#241;os. A lo largo de las dos \&\#250;ltimas d\&\#233;cadas, la diferencia entre la esperanza de vida de los dos sexos se ha estabilizado e incluso ha empezado a reducirse y dicha reducci\&\#243;n se debe fundamentalmente a una aceleraci\&\#243;n de los progresos masculinos y a una relajaci\&\#243;n de los progresos femeninos antes de los 60 a\&\#241;os, f\&\#225;ciles de percibir en ambos casos.

The incidence of COVID-19, the disease associated with this new coronavirus, continues to rise. The epidemic threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, and identifying those regions where the disease burden is likely to be high relative to the rest of the country is critical for enabling prudent and effective distribution of emergency medical care and public health resources. Globally, the risk of severe outcomes associated with COVID-19 has consistently been observed to increase with age2,3. We used age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data to map projections of the cumulative case burden of COVID-19 and the subsequent burden on healthcare resources. The analysis was performed at the county level across the United States, assuming a scenario in which 20\% of the population of each county acquires infection. We identified counties that will probably be consistently, heavily affected relative to the rest of the country across a range of assumptions about transmission patterns, such as the basic reproductive rate, contact patterns and the efficacy of quarantine. We observed a general pattern that per capita disease burden and relative healthcare system demand may be highest away from major population centers. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring equitable and adequate allocation of medical care and public health resources to communities outside of major urban areas.},

Methods: Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately ( 13\%) black and all other ({$<$}13\% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated, and population attributable fractions were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results: Nearly 90\% of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49\% (330/677) reported a death versus 81\% (1987/2465) and 28\% (684/2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (Rate Ratio (RR): 1.24, 95\% confidence interval: 1.17e1.33) and deaths (RR: 1.18, 95\% confidence interval: 1.00e1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The population attributable fraction of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3\% for counties with less than 13\% black residents and 4.2\% for counties with greater than or equal to 13\% black residents. Conclusions: Nearly 20\% of U.S. counties are disproportionately black, and they accounted for 52\% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58\% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.},

  abstract = {The popularity of online surveys has increased the prominence of using sampling weights to enhance claims of representativeness. Yet, much uncertainty remains regarding how these weights should be employed in survey experiment analysis: should they be used? If so, which estimators are preferred? We offer practical advice, rooted in the Neyman--Rubin model, for researchers working with survey experimental data. We examine simple, efficient estimators, and give formulas for their biases and variances. We provide simulations that examine these estimators as well as real examples from experiments administered online through YouGov. We find that for examining the existence of population treatment effects using high-quality, broadly representative samples recruited by top online survey firms, sample quantities, which do not rely on weights, are often sufficient. We found that sample average treatment effect (SATE) estimates did not appear to differ substantially from their weighted counterparts, and they avoided the substantial loss of statistical power that accompanies weighting. When precise estimates of population average treatment effects (PATE) are essential, we analytically show poststratifying on survey weights and/or covariates highly correlated with outcomes to be a conservative choice. While we show substantial gains in simulations, we find limited evidence of them in practice.},

We show how to transform bipartite graph and directed graph into corresponding unipartite graph, therefore allowing a unified treatment to all cases. In bipartite graph, we show that the relaxed solution to the \$K\$-way co-clustering can be found by computing the left and right eigenvectors of the data matrix. This gives a theoretical basis for \$K\$-way spectral co-clustering algorithms proposed in the literatures. We also show that solving row and column co-clustering is equivalent to solving row and column clustering separately, thus giving a theoretical support for the claim: ``column clustering implies row clustering and vice versa''. And in the last part, we generalize the Ky Fan theorem---which is the central theorem for explaining spectral clustering---to rectangular complex matrix motivated by the results from bipartite graph analysis.},

Contrary to the traditional models that design a neural network that learns a classifier or a regressor, we propose a learning objective based on the nDCG ranking metric.

Notably, the magnitude of ingroup colorism's associations with most of these outcomes rivals or even exceeds that of major lifetime discrimination, everyday discrimination, and perceived outgroup colorism. These findings compellingly suggest the inclusion of perceived colorism measures in future survey data collection efforts.},

Much of this work is rooted in comparing the life chances, trajectories, and outcomes of African Americans to White Americans. From health to wealth and nearly every measure of well-being, success, and thriving one can find, White Americans remain ahead of Black Americans. What this focus on ethnoracial inequality between ``groups'' obscures, however, is long-standing skin tone inequality within groups. In this essay, I trace the trajectory of colorism and skin tone stratification in the United States over the past century. Next, I high-light the contemporary persistence of skin tone stratification, not only among African Americans, but among Latinx and Asian Americans as well. I conclude by arguing that future research on colorism will be essential to understand comprehensively the significance of race/ethnicity in a demographically shifting United States (such as immigration and ``multiraciality'').},

  abstract = {Background: Since 1998 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization has provided estimates on the magnitude of the HIV epidemic for individual countries. Starting with the 2003 estimates, plausibility bounds about the estimates were also reported. The bounds are intended to serve as a guide as to what reasonable or plausible ranges are for the uncertainty in HIV incidence, prevalence, and mortality. Methods: Plausibility bounds were developed for three situations: for countries with generalised epidemics, for countries with low level or concentrated epidemics (LLC), and for regions. The techniques used build on those developed for the previous reporting round. However the current bounds are based on the available surveillance and survey data from each individual country rather than on data from a few prototypical countries. Results: The uncertainty around the HIV estimates depends on the quality of the surveillance system in the country. Countries with population based HIV seroprevalence surveys have the tightest plausibility bounds (average relative range about the adult HIV prevalence (ARR) of -18\% to +19\%.) Generalised epidemic countries without a survey have the next tightest ranges (average ARR of -46\% to +59\%). Those LLC countries which have conducted multiple surveys over time for HIV among the populations most at risk have the bounds similar to those in generalised epidemic countries (ARR -40\% to +67\%). As the number and quality of the studies in LLC countries goes down, the plausibility bounds increase (ARR of -38\% to +102\% for countries with medium quality data and ARR of -53\% to +183\% for countries with poor quality data). The plausibility bounds for regions directly reflect the bounds for the countries in those regions. Conclusions: Although scientific, the plausibility bounds do not represent and should not be interpreted as formal statistical confidence intervals. However in order to make the bounds as meaningful as possible the authors have tried to apply reasonable statistical approaches and assumptions to their derivation. An understanding of the uncertainty in the HIV estimates may help policy makers take better informed decisions to address the epidemic in their respective countries.},

Recently, family planning researchers have introduced a new method called the list experiment, adopted from political science and economics, to measure abortion. Three completed studies and at least four studies currently underway use this method to measure abortion in several countries. We discuss the lessons learned from completed studies, when the list experiment may and may not be appropriate, and open questions regarding the use of the list experiment for abortion research. This method has the potential to improve measures of abortion prevalence and incidence, which could translate to better-informed interventions to increase abortion access and reduce unmet need for family planning. Future research should further clarify the advantages and limitations of the list experiment for measuring abortion.},

Methods: In the randomized-response technique, a randomization device is used to determine whether participants are asked to respond truthfully or whether they are prompted to provide a prespecified response. In this study, the randomized-response technique was extended by using a cheating-detection modification to obtain more valid data. The survey was on the dental hygiene habits of Chinese college students. Results: Whereas only 35\% of men and 10\% of women admitted to insufficient dental hygiene when questioned directly, 51\% of men and 20\% of women attested to this socially undesirable behavior in a randomized-response survey. Conclusions: Given the considerable discrepancy between the results obtained by direct questioning and by using the randomized-response technique, we propose that this technique be considered for use in epidemiologic studies of sensitive behaviors.}

  abstract = {Studies addressing sensitive issues often yield distorted prevalence estimates due to socially desirable responding. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce this bias, including indirect questioning, psychophysiological lie detection, and bogus pipeline procedures. However, the increase in resources required by these techniques is warranted only if there is a substantial increase in validity as compared to direct questions. Convincing demonstration of superior validity necessitates the availability of a criterion reflecting the ``true'' prevalence of a sensitive attribute. Unfortunately, such criteria are notoriously difficult to obtain, which is why validation studies often proceed indirectly by simply comparing estimates obtained with different methods. Comparative validation studies, however, provide weak evidence only since the exact increase in validity (if any) remains unknown. To remedy this problem, we propose a simple method that allows for measuring the ``true'' prevalence of a sensitive behavior experimentally. The basic idea is to elicit normatively problematic behavior in a way that ensures conclusive knowledge of the prevalence rate of this behavior. This prevalence measure can then serve as an external validation criterion in a second step. An empirical demonstration of this method is provided.

The randomized-response technique (RRT) encourages more honest responding by adding random noise to responses, thereby removing any direct link between a participant's response and his or her true status with regard to a sensitive attribute. However, in spite of the increased confidentiality, some respondents still refuse to disclose sensitive attitudes or behaviors. To remedy this problem, we propose an extension of Mangat's (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B, 56, 93--95, 1994) variant of the RRT that allows for determining whether participants respond truthfully. This method offers the genuine advantage of providing undistorted prevalence estimates for sensitive attributes even if respondents fail to respond truthfully. We show how to implement the method using both closed-form equations and easily accessible free software for multinomial processing tree models. Moreover, we report the results of two survey experiments that provide evidence for the validity of our extension of Mangat's RRT approach.},

Second, traditional RRT models do not take the problem of nonadherence to the instructions into account. We describe a modification of the RRT that is capable of surveying multiple attributes using just a single randomization process and controls for nonadherence. An empirical application demonstrates the superiority of this approach over both, direct questioning and the forced-response variant of the RRT.}

  abstract = {Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e., transitivity, clustering): network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to be directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se versus other processes such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These mechanisms are difficult to disentangle in many settings. On social media, however, they can be decomposed - and platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when they are followed by a target account that we control. We then examine whether the user reciprocates this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35\%. Through multiple control conditions, we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and accordingly we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these tendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and information diffusion in online networks.}

This paper argues that the competitive market prices of mortality contingent claims, such as annuities and life-insurance, contain information which allow one to infer the opinion of the market regarding the pace of the continued increase in old-age longevity. The paper develops methods to identify and estimate the mortality implicit in the market prices of such claims by identifying survival functions from prices of contracts that differ in their duration. Utilizing these methods, we provide estimates using cohort-specific prices of US term life insurance contracts in 1990-96 for individuals aged 60 in each calendar year. Our main finding is that the mortality patterns inferred from these prices indicate a continued decline in cohort-specific mortality at rates equal to or greater than recent historical trends; about a 5 percent reduction in relative terms in the mortality hazards per successive cohort.}

  abstract = {The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) began 30 years ago with the goal of providing timely, valid and relevant assessments of critical health outcomes. Over this period, the GBD has become progressively more granular. The latest iteration provides assessments of thousands of outcomes for diseases, injuries and risk factors in more than 200 countries and territories and at the subnational level in more than 20 countries. The GBD is now produced by an active collaboration of over 8,000 scientists and analysts from more than 150 countries. With each GBD iteration, the data, data processing and methods used for data synthesis have evolved, with the goal of enhancing transparency and comparability of measurements and communicating various sources of uncertainty. The GBD has many limitations, but it remains a dynamic, iterative and rigorous attempt to provide meaningful health measurement to a wide range of stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Background HIV prevalence is disproportionately high among female sex workers compared to the general population. Many African countries lack useful data on the size of female sex worker populations to inform national HIV programs. Methodology A female sex worker size estimation exercise using three different venue-based methodologies was conducted among female sex workers in all provinces of Rwanda in August 2010. The female sex worker national population size was estimated using capture--recapture and enumeration methods, and the multiplier method was used to estimate the size of female sex worker in Kigali. A structured questionnaire was also used to supplement the data. Results The estimated number of female sex workers by the capture--recapture method was 3205 (95\% confidence interval: 2998--3412). The female sex worker size was estimated at 3348 using the enumeration method. In Kigali, the female sex worker size was estimated at 2253 (95\% confidence interval: 1916--2524) using the multiplier method. Nearly 80\% of all female sex workers in Rwanda were found to be based in the capital, Kigali. Conclusion This study provided a first-time estimate of the female sex worker population size in Rwanda using capture--recapture, enumeration, and multiplier methods. The capture--recapture and enumeration methods provided similar estimates of female sex worker in Rwanda. Combination of such size estimation methods is feasible and productive in low-resource settings and should be considered vital to inform national HIV programs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies of weight change and mortality in older adults have relied on self-reported weight loss, have not evaluated weight gain, or have had limited information on health status. Our objective was to determine whether 5\% weight gain or loss in 3 years was predictive of mortality in a large sample of older adults. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational cohort study. SETTING: Four U.S. communities. PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand seven hundred fourteen community-dwelling older adults, age 65 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Weight gain or loss of 5\% in a 3-year period was examined in relationship to baseline health status and interim health events. Risk for subsequent mortality was estimated in those with weight loss or weight gain compared with the group whose weight was stable. RESULTS: Weight changes occurred in 34.6\% of women and 27.3\% of men, with weight loss being more frequent than gain. Weight loss was associated with older age, black race, higher weight, lower waist circumference, current smoking, stroke, any hospitalization, death of a spouse, activities of daily living disability, lower grip strength, and slower gait speed. Weight loss but not weight gain of 5\% or more was associated with an increased risk of mortality that persisted after multivariate adjustment (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.67, 95\% CI = 1.29--2.15) and was similar in those with no serious illness in the period of weight change. Those with weight loss and low baseline weight had the highest crude mortality rate, although the HR for weight loss was similar for all tertiles of baseline weight and for those with or without a special diet, compared with those whose weight was stable. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that even modest decline in body weight is an important and independent marker of risk of mortality in older adults. J Am Geriatr Soc 49:1309--1318, 2001.},

It was shown that both techniques lead to different networks not only with respect to morphological features of social networks, but also and more importantly with respect to functional and relational features. The recognition technique seems to be useful in collecting exchange networks with high numbers of network members and strong activity, while free recall produces networks which are smaller and less active in comparison, but nevertheless can be identified as networks of significant others.},

  abstract = {Background For a better understanding of the current situation of drug use in Iran, we utilized the network scale-up approach to estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use in the entire country. Methods We implemented a self-administered, street-based questionnaire to 7535 passersby from the general public over 18 years of age by street based random walk quota sampling (based on gender, age and socio-economic status) from 31 provinces in Iran. The sample size in each province was approximately 400, ranging from 200 to 1000. In each province 75\% of sample was recruited from the capital and the remaining 25\% was recruited from one of the large cities of that province through stratified sampling. The questionnaire comprised questions on demographic information as well as questions to measure the total network size of participants as well as the network size in each of seven drug use groups including Opium, Shire (combination of Opium residue and pure opium), Crystal Methamphetamine, heroin/crack (which in Iranian context is a cocaine-free drug that mostly contains heroin, codeine, morphine and caffeine with or without other drugs), Hashish, Methamphetamine/LSD/ecstasy, and injecting drugs. The estimated size for each group was adjusted for transmission and barrier ratios. Results The most common type of illicit drug used was opium with the prevalence of 1500 per 100,000 population followed by shire (660), crystal methamphetamine (590), hashish (470), heroin/crack (350), methamphetamine, LSD and ecstasy (300) and injecting drugs (280). All types of substances were more common among men than women. The use of opium, shire and injecting drugs was more common in individuals over 30 whereas the use of stimulants and hashish was largest among individuals between 18 and 30 years of age. Conclusion It seems that younger individuals and women are more desired to use new synthetic drugs such as crystal methamphetamine. Extending the preventive programs especially in youth as like as scaling up harm reduction services would be the main priorities in prevention and control of substance use in Iran. Because of poor service coverage and high stigma in women, more targeted programs in this affected population are needed.},

In this paper, we use agent-based simulations of a network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to investigate two network intervention strategies for mitigating the spread of transmission while maintaining economic activities. In the simulations, we assume that people engage in group activities in multiple sectors (e.g., going to work, going to a local grocery store), where they interact with others in the same group and potentially become infected. In the first strategy, each group is divided into two subgroups (e.g., a group of customers can only go to the grocery store in the morning, while another separate group of customers can only go in the afternoon). In the second strategy, we balance the number of group members across different groups within the same sector (e.g., every grocery store has the same number of customers). The simulation results show that the dividing groups strategy substantially reduces transmission, and the joint implementation of the two strategies could effectively bring the spread of transmission under control (i.e., effective reproduction number {$\approx$} 1.0).},

A portion of the billions of photos posted to Facebook generates cascades of reshares, enabling many additional users to see, like, comment, and reshare the photos. In this paper we present characteristics of such cascades in aggregate, finding that a small fraction of photos account for a significant proportion of reshare activity and generate cascades of non-trivial size and depth. We also show that the true influence chains in such cascades can be much deeper than what is visible through direct attribution. To illuminate how large cascades can form, we study the diffusion trees of two widely distributed photos: one posted on President Barack Obama's page following his reelection victory, and another posted by an individual Facebook user hoping to garner enough likes for a cause. We show that the two cascades, despite achieving comparable total sizes, are markedly different in their time evolution, reshare depth distribution, predictability of subcascade sizes, and the demographics of users who propagate them. The findings suggest not only that cascades can achieve considerable size but that they can do so in distinct ways.},

  abstract = {A/B testing is a standard approach for evaluating the effect of online experiments; the goal is to estimate the `average treatment effect' of a new feature or condition by exposing a sample of the overall population to it. A drawback with A/B testing is that it is poorly suited for experiments involving social interference, when the treatment of individuals spills over to neighboring individuals along an underlying social network. In this work, we propose a novel methodology using graph clustering to analyze average treatment effects under social interference. To begin, we characterize graph-theoretic conditions under which individuals can be considered to be 'network exposed' to an experiment.  We then show how graph cluster randomization admits an efficient exact algorithm to compute the probabilities for each vertex being network exposed under several of these exposure conditions. Using these probabilities as inverse weights, a Horvitz-Thompson estimator can then provide an effect estimate that is unbiased, provided that the exposure model has been properly specified. Given an estimator that is unbiased, we focus on minimizing the variance. First, we develop simple sufficient conditions for the variance of the estimator to be asymptotically small in \$n\$, the size of the graph. However, for general randomization schemes, this variance can be lower bounded by an exponential function of the degrees of a graph. In contrast, we show that if a graph satisfies a restricted-growth condition on the growth rate of neighborhoods, then there exists a natural clustering algorithm, based on vertex neighborhoods, for which the variance of the estimator can be upper bounded by a linear function of the degrees. Thus we show that proper cluster randomization can lead to exponentially lower estimator variance when experimentally measuring average treatment effects under interference.},

Ground truth was established by asking users themselves to name their closest friends in real life.

Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27\% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals -- friend count, likes, and comments -- vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61\% of their friends each month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social networks.},

In practice, multiple hash tables are usually employed to retrieve more desired results from all hit buckets of each table. However, there are rare works studying the unified approach to constructing multiple informative hash tables except the widely used random way. In this paper, we regard the table construction as a selection problem over a set of candidate hash functions. With the graph representation of the function set, we propose an efficient solution that sequentially applies normalized dominant set to finding the most informative and independent hash functions for each table. To further reduce the redundancy between tables, we explore the reciprocal hash tables in a boosting manner, where the hash function graph is updated with high weights emphasized on the misclassified neighbor pairs of previous hash tables. The construction method is general and compatible with different types of hashing algorithms using different feature spaces and/or parameter settings. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both naive construction method and state-of-the-art hashing algorithms, with up to 65.93\% accuracy gains.},

  abstract = {Most models of social contagion take peer exposure to be a corollary of adoption, yet in many settings, the visibility of one's adoption behavior happens through a separate decision process. In online systems, product designers can define how peer exposure mechanisms work: adoption behaviors can be shared in a passive, automatic fashion, or occur through explicit, active sharing. The consequences of these mechanisms are of substantial practical and theoretical interest: passive sharing may increase total peer exposure but active sharing may expose higher quality products to peers who are more likely to adopt. We examine selection effects in online sharing through a large-scale field experiment on Facebook that randomizes whether or not adopters share Offers (coupons) in a passive manner. We derive and estimate a joint discrete choice model of adopters' sharing decisions and their peers' adoption decisions. Our results show that active sharing enables a selection effect that exposes peers who are more likely to adopt than the population exposed under passive sharing. We decompose the selection effect into two distinct mechanisms: active sharers expose peers to higher quality products, and the peers they share with are more likely to adopt independently of product quality. Simulation results show that the user-level mechanism comprises the bulk of the selection effect. The study's findings are among the first to address downstream peer effects induced by online sharing mechanisms, and can inform design in settings where a surplus of sharing could be viewed as costly.},

We study this problem in a fully Bayesian setting, focusing on the problem of using Facebook user-IDs as features, with the social network giving the relationship structure. Our analysis uncovers significant problems with the obvious regularizations, and motivates a two-component mixture-model ``social prior'' that is provably better. Empirical results on large-scale click prediction problems show that our algorithm can learn as well as the baseline with \$12M\$ fewer training examples, and continuously outperforms it for over \$60M\$ examples. On a second problem using binned features, our model outperforms the baseline even after the latter sees 5x as much data.},

  abstract = {A growing set of on-line applications are generating data that can be viewed as very large collections of small, dense social graphs --- these range from sets of social groups, events, or collaboration projects to the vast collection of graph neighborhoods in large social networks. A natural question is how to usefully define a domain-independent `coordinate system' for such a collection of graphs, so that the set of possible structures can be compactly represented and understood within a common space. In this work, we draw on the theory of graph homomorphisms to formulate and analyze such a representation, based on computing the frequencies of small induced subgraphs within each graph. We find that the space of subgraph frequencies is governed both by its combinatorial properties --- based on extremal results that constrain all graphs --- as well as by its empirical properties --- manifested in the way that real social graphs appear to lie near a simple one-dimensional curve through this space. We develop flexible frameworks for studying each of these aspects. For capturing empirical properties, we characterize a simple stochastic generative model, a single-parameter extension of Erdos-Renyi random graphs, whose stationary distribution over subgraphs closely tracks the one-dimensional concentration of the real social graph families. For the extremal properties, we develop a tractable linear program for bounding the feasible space of subgraph frequencies by harnessing a toolkit of known extremal graph theory. Together, these two complementary frameworks shed light on a fundamental question pertaining to social graphs: what properties of social graphs are `social' properties and what properties are `graph' properties? We conclude with a brief demonstration of how the coordinate system we examine can also be used to perform classification tasks, distinguishing between structures arising from different types of social graphs.},

  abstract = {Recent research shows an increasing interest in the interplay of social networks and infectious diseases. Many studies either neglect explicit changes in health behavior or consider networks to be static, despite empirical evidence that people seek to distance themselves from diseases in social networks. We propose an adaptable steppingstone model that integrates theories of social network formation from sociology, risk perception from health psychology, and infectious diseases from epidemiology. We argue that networking behavior in the context of infectious diseases can be described as a trade-off between the benefits, efforts, and potential harm a connection creates. Agent-based simulations of a specific model case show that: (i) high (perceived) health risks create strong social distancing, thus resulting in low epidemic sizes; (ii) small changes in health behavior can be decisive for whether the outbreak of a disease turns into an epidemic or not; (iii) high benefits for social connections create more ties per agent, providing large numbers of potential transmission routes and opportunities for the disease to travel faster, and (iv) higher costs of maintaining ties with infected others reduce final size of epidemics only when benefits of indirect ties are relatively low. These findings suggest a complex interplay between social network, health behavior, and infectious disease dynamics. Furthermore, they contribute to solving the issue that neglect of explicit health behavior in models of disease spread may create mismatches between observed transmissibility and epidemic sizes of model predictions.},

This procedure employs a diverse ensemble of predictive models---including multilevel regression, LASSO, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boosting---to improve the cross-validated fit of the first-stage predictions. In a Monte Carlo simulation, SRP significantly outperforms MRP when there are deep interactions in the data generating process, without requiring the researcher to specify a complex parametric model in advance. In an empirical application, I show that SRP produces superior local public opinion estimates on a broad range of issue areas, particularly when trained on large datasets.},

  abstract = {While negative correlations have often been found between a respondent's education and his attitudes towards foreigners, the reasons for this education effect are still under debate. We examined the hypothesis that the highly educated may not be genuinely less xenophobic, but simply more prone to give socially desirable, xenophile answers in attitude questionnaires. We therefore compared the attitudes of respondents who were either questioned directly or using a cheating detection extension of the randomized-response technique (RRT). The latter is supposed to yield more honest answers to sensitive questions by experimentally offering the interviewee a higher degree of confidentiality. Under direct questioning conditions, we replicated the education effect; 75\% of the highly educated expressed xenophile attitudes, as opposed to only 55\% of the less educated. Under randomized-response conditions, we obtained significantly reduced estimates of 53\% for the proportion of xenophiles among the highly educated, and 24\% among the less educated, indicating a strong distortion of self-reported attitudes towards foreigners in both groups. However, a significant proportion of participants disobeyed the RRT instructions regardless of education. Because the education effect was found even after controlling for social desirability, it seems to be a genuine effect, rather than an artefact of a differential response bias.

More than one thousand census and population register records are combined to construct decennial matrices corresponding to the five census rounds between 1960 and 2000. For the first time, a comprehensive picture of bilateral global migration over the second half of the 20th century emerges. The data reveal that the global migrant stock increased from 92 million in 1960 to 165 million in 2000. Quantitatively, migration between developing countries dominates, constituting half of all international migration in 2000. When the partition of India and the dissolution of the Soviet Union are accounted for, migration between developing countries is remarkably stable over the period. Migration from developing to developed countries is the fastest growing component of international migration in both absolute and relative terms. The United States has remained the most important migrant destination in the world, home to one fifth of the world's migrants and the top destination for migrants from some 60 sending countries. Migration to Western Europe has come largely from elsewhere in Europe. The oil-rich Persian Gulf countries emerge as important destinations for migrants from the Middle East and North Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Finally, although the global migrant stock is predominantly male, the proportion of female migrants increased noticeably between 1960 and 2000. The number of women rose in every region except South Asia.},

People can infer, for instance, the relative frequency of different diseases by probing how many members of their social network suffer from them. How are such instance-based inferences cognitively implemented? Noncompensatory strategies based on lexicographic and limited search have been extensively examined in the context of cue-based inference. Their role in instance-based inference, by contrast, has received scant attention. We propose the social-circle heuristic as a model of noncompensatory instance-based inference entailing lexicographic and limited search, and test its descriptive and prescriptive implications: To what extent do people rely on the social-circle heuristic? How accurate is the noncompensatory heuristic relative to a compensatory strategy when inferring event frequencies? Two empirical studies show that the heuristic accurately predicts the judgments of a substantial portion of participants. A response time analysis also supports the assumption of lexicographic search: The earlier the heuristic predicted search to be terminated, the faster participants classified as using the social-circle heuristic responded. Using computer simulations to systematically investigate the heuristic's prescriptive implications, we find that despite its limited search, the heuristic can approximate the accuracy of a compensatory strategy in skewed and in spatially clustered environments---both common properties of distributions in real-world social environments.},

Selection without replacement from within strata with probability proportional to size. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. B 15, 253--261], provided the parent sampling design involves a constant number of distinct units in every sample to be chosen. If the design, in addition, ensures uniform non-negativity of this variance estimator, Rao and Wu [1988. Resampling inference with complex survey data. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 83, 231--241] have given their re-scaling bootstrap technique to construct confidence interval and to estimate mean square error for non-linear functions of finite population totals of several real variables. Horvitz and Thompson's estimators (HTE) are used to estimate the finite population totals. Since they need to equate the bootstrap variance of the bootstrap estimator to the Yates and Grundy's estimator (YGE) for the variance of the HTE in case of a single variable, i.e., in the linear case the YG variance estimator is required to be positive for the sample usually drawn. In case a sampling design permits (i) the number of distinct units to vary across samples and (ii) negativity of the variance estimator for the basic unbiased estimator for the finite population total of a single variable to start with, we propose here a modification on Rao and Wu's bootstrap technique. The main utility of it is to construct confidence intervals for finite population correlation and regression coefficients, in particular, among general non-linear functionals, avoiding normality assumption and instead studying the approximate distributions of their bootstrap point estimators.},

In such an experiment, the treatment group users are exposed to some display advertising campaign, while the control group users are not. During the campaign and the post-campaign period we monitor the user search queries and we label them as relevant or irrelevant to the campaign using techniques that leverage the bipartite query-URL click graph. Our results indicate that users who are exposed to the advertising campaign submit 5\% to 25\% more queries that are relevant to it compared to the unexposed users. Using the social graph of the experiment users, we also explore how users are affected by their friends who are exposed to ads. Our results indicate that a user with exposed friends is more likely to submit queries relevant to the campaign, as compared to a user without exposed friends. The result is surprising given that the display advertising campaign that we study does not include any incentive for social action, e.g., discount for recommending friends.},

This approach combines the modeling approach often used in small-area estimation with the population information used in poststratification (see Gelman and Little 1997, Survey Methodology 23:127--135). To validate the method, we apply it to U.S. preelection polls for 1988 and 1992, poststratified by state, region, and the usual demographic variables. We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes. The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political science. We envision the most important usage of this method to be not forecasting elections but estimating public opinion on a variety of issues at the state level.}

Their effectiveness is tested on data sets with different levels of noise and on medical diagnosis data sets. The methods are most effective when the noise level in the data is high or the size of the learning set is small, which consequently produces high variance. The algorithms will not be of much help in cases where the error of prediction is mainly due to bias. An increase in bias is observed due to smaller effective learning size in the bootstrap and crossvalidation committee. The impact of increased bias on the performance ranges from negligible to completely undermining the benefit of reducing the variance.}

The first capture was done by distributing key chains to both MSM and FSW populations through local non-governmental organizations (NGO) that work with these groups. The second capture was done during the course of an integrated behavioural and biological survey (IBBS) using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The proportion receiving a key chain estimated from the IBBS study was adjusted by RDS-derived weights.Results The first capture included 400 FSW and 400 MSM. Of the 624 MSM interviewed in the IBBS, 36 (5.8\% crude; 3.2\% adjusted RDS) had received the key chain. The estimated population size of MSM in San Salvador was 12\hphantom{,}480 (95\% CI 7235 to 17\hphantom{,}725). Of the 663 FSW interviewed in the IBBS, 39 (5.9\% crude; 6.9\% adjusted RDS) had received the key chain. The estimated number of FSW was 5765 (95\% CI 4253 to 7277).Conclusions The capture--recapture exercise was successfully linked to an IBBS to obtain city-level population sizes for MSM and FSW, providing valuable information at a low cost. Size estimates are crucial for programme planning for national AIDS programmes, NGOs and stakeholders working with these populations and for HIV projection models.}

After surveying several options, we empirically examined two such platforms, CrowdFlower (CF) and Prolific Academic (ProA). In two studies, we found that participants on both platforms were more na{\"i}ve and less dishonest compared to MTurk participants. Across the three platforms, CF provided the best response rate, but CF participants failed more attention-check questions and did not reproduce known effects replicated on ProA and MTurk. Moreover, ProA participants produced data quality that was higher than CF's and comparable to MTurk's. ProA and CF participants were also much more diverse than participants from MTurk.},

This indicator is often used to support decisions, but its relevance is intensified when measurements are taken at detailed levels. In this context, this study sets out to calculate the Municipal Human Development Index for 5,507 municipalities in Brazil. As a result, cities were classified into four development levels. Among Brazilian cities, 2.63\% were classified as having a very high human development, 25.48\% as high, 33.14\% as medium, and 38.75\% as low. The classification of approximately 54\% of the municipalities was changed. The new approach enabled areas to be classified in a way that was more faithful to reality, without considering that half the population lives with a high quality of life. The multicriteria method ELECTRE TRI-C was used to mitigate some criticism of the index.}

  abstract = {le explores the influence of information overload on online democratic processes. The study of this problematic is motivated by the increasing importance of the doctrine of transparency, by the central role of the paradigm of informed citizenship in contemporary political thought, and by the empirical observation that the modern citizen is exposed to increasing amounts of political data. To explore this question, the article develops a rigorous understanding of the concept of information overload in the democratic context. The article argues, drawing on empirical studies which highlight the adverse psychological impacts of cognitive overload, that this problematic can undermine the capacity of the Internet to reinvigorate democratic praxis. It considers two different responses to this threat. The first questions the seriousness of this threat by re-conceptualizing democracy as a 'low-information' practice. This 'shallow' understanding of democracy emphasizes the role of heuristics and political intermediaries in modern democratic life. While acknowledging the important role of heuristics and political intermediaries, the article questions the capacity of this narrative to provide a coherent account of legitimate democratic governance. The article proceeds to consider an alternative, technological-oriented response to the problem of information overload. This approach highlights the capacity of new technological innovations to resolve the information overload problematic by reducing the cognitive burden associated with web-based political action. The article uses a concrete case study - the advanced online participatory framework offered by TransLink, the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority - to highlight how the information overload problem is manifested in an actual political context. The article concludes by exploring the blind-spots of these different technological innovations. It considers in this context the role of a new class of political players-techno-political intermediaries - and discusses their potential influence on the democratic process. This discussion points to certain deficiencies in the current doctrine of transparency (and the paradigm of the 'informed citizen' underlying it), which is insensitive both to the cognitive limitations of the average citizen and to the increasingly important (but hidden) role of techno-political intermediaries in the political process as it draws increasingly on online tools.},

Well-defined statistical techniques for quantifying patterns of mortality within a cohort and identifying differences in age-specific mortality among cohorts are needed. Here I discuss using maximum likelihood (ML) statistical methods to estimate the parameters of mathematical models, which are used to describe the change in mortality with age. ML provides a convenient and powerful framework for choosing an adequate mortality model, estimating model parameters and testing hypotheses about differences in parameters among experimental or ecological treatments. Simulations suggest that experiments designed to estimate age-specific mortality should involve at least 100-500 individuals per cohort per treatment. Significant bias in the estimation of model parameters is introduced when the mortality model is misspecified and samples are too small to detect the true mortality pattern. Furthermore, the lack of simple and efficient procedures for comparing different mortality models has forced the use of the Gompertz model, which specifies an exponentially increasing mortality with age, and which may not apply to the majority of experimental systems.},

This observation is inconsistent with the equilibrium predictions of both the antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation models of senescence, which, under a wide variety of assumptions, predict a 'wall' of mortality rates near 100\% at postreproductive ages. Previous models of age-specific mortality patterns are discussed in light of recent demographic data concerning late-age mortality deceleration and age-specific properties of new mutations. The most recent theory (Mueller and Rose 1996) argues that existing evolutionary models can easily and robustly explain the demographic data. Here we discuss the sensitivity of that analysis to different types of mutational effects, and demonstrate that its conclusion is very sensitive to assumptions about mutations. A legitimate resolution of evolutionary theory and demographic data will require experimental observations on the age-specificity of mutational effects for new mutations and the degree to which mortality rates in adjacent ages are constrained to be similar (positive pleiotropy), as well as consideration of redundancy and heterogeneity models from demographic theory.},

In this paper methods are presented that clarify the relationship between differences in the longevity of two populations and differences in their underlying age-specific patterns of mortality. Data are examined from rodent and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) experiments that investigated the longevity effects of a variety of environmental and genetic manipulations, including temperature, dietary restriction, laboratory selection for increased longevity, and severe inbreeding. Analyses suggest that longevity differences mediated by temperature and dietary restriction result predominantly from differences in the rate of increase in mortality with age. Increases in longevity through laboratory selection result primarily from a reduction in baseline mortality and not a slowing of the rate of aging. Although the methods are applied primarily in the context of simple mathematical models of mortality (e.g., the Gompertz model), they are quite general and can be applied to mortality models of arbitrary complexity. Mathematica protocols (``notebooks'') and computer software have been developed to perform all the analyses discussed and are available from the first author.}

  abstract = {Background Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a {\^O}hidden{\~O} population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e.g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, M{\'e}xico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits. Conclusions SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.}

It distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.},

It compares couples that met online (through either online dating platforms, Internet social networking, Internet gaming website, Internet chat, Internet community, etc.) to those that met through various offline contexts of interaction. Using unique data from the U.S. for the year 2009 and data from Germany collected between 2008 and 2014, I run log-multiplicative models that allow for the strength of partners' association to vary along meeting settings.

Large-scale simulation models are used to predict epidemic dynamics and evaluate the impact of various interventions, but the contact behavior in these models is based on simplistic and strong assumptions which are not informed by survey data. These assumptions are also used for estimating transmission measures such as the basic reproductive number and secondary attack rates. Development of methodology to infer contact networks from survey data could improve these models and estimation methods. We contribute to this area by developing a model of within-household social contacts and using it to analyze the Belgian POLYMOD data set, which contains detailed diaries of social contacts in a 24-hour period. We model dependency in contact behavior through a latent variable indicating which household members are at home. We estimate age-specific probabilities of being at home and age-specific probabilities of contact conditional on two members being at home. Our results differ from the standard random mixing assumption. In addition, we find that the probability that all members contact each other on a given day is fairly low: 0.49 for households with two 0--5 year olds and two 19--35 year olds, and 0.36 for households with two 12--18 year olds and two 36+ year olds. We find higher contact rates in households with 2--3 members, helping explain the higher influenza secondary attack rates found in households of this size.},

We develop a penalized likelihood method to infer contact networks within households, which are a key area for disease transmission. Using egocentric surveys of contact behaviour in Belgium, we estimate within-household contact networks for six different age compositions. Our estimates show dependence in contact behaviour and vary substantively by age composition, with fewer contacts in older households.

Whereas the need for social approval did not show a significant effect on the probability of an honest answer when controlling for other variables, trait desirability did. Regarding the face-to-face survey, the more interviews an interviewer had successfully completed in the ongoing study, the higher the response quality of the interviewees.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). Findings Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92\% (IQR 66--97) and 24\% (13--90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. Interpretation Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

  abstract = {Heterogeneities in contact networks have a major effect in determining whether a pathogen can become epidemic or persist at endemic levels. Epidemic models that determine which interventions can successfully prevent an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns. Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.g. home, work, and school), and including them as predictors in transmission dynamic models of pathogens that spread socially will improve the models' realism. Data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the POLYMOD study were projected to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated the proclivity of age-and-location-specific contact patterns for the countries, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Household level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for nine lower-income countries and socio-demographic factors from several on-line databases for 152 countries were used to quantify similarity of countries to estimate contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations for countries for which no contact data are available, accounting for demographic structure, household structure where known, and a variety of metrics including workforce participation and school enrolment. Contacts are highly assortative with age across all countries considered, but pronounced regional differences in the age-specific contacts at home were noticeable, with more inter-generational contacts in Asian countries than in other settings. Moreover, there were variations in contact patterns by location, with work-place contacts being least assortative. These variations led to differences in the effect of social distancing measures in an age structured epidemic model. Contacts have an important role in transmission dynamic models that use contact rates to characterize the spread of contact-transmissible diseases. This study provides estimates of mixing patterns for societies for which contact data such as POLYMOD are not yet available.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices reproduce the main traits of the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, the analysis of age-specific mortality rates is plagued by specific statistical challenges caused by sampling error. Here we discuss the nature of this `demographic sampling error', and the way in which it can bias our estimates of (1) rates of ageing, (2) age at onset of senescence, (3) costs of reproduction and (4) demographic tests of evolutionary models of ageing. We conducted simulations which suggest that using standard statistical techniques, we would need sample sizes on the order of tens of thousands in most experiments to effectively remove any bias due to sampling error. We argue that biologists should use much larger sample sizes than have previously been used. However, we also present simple maximum likelihood models that effectively remove biases due to demographic sampling error even at relatively small sample sizes.},

In this paper, we identify ways that surveys designed to collect multiplex social network data might be vulnerable to question-order effects. We then test several hypotheses using a split-ballot experiment embedded in an online multiple name generator survey of teachers' advice networks, collected for a study of complete networks. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of multiple name generator social network surveys.},

Owen showed that empirical likelihood ratio statistics for various parameters {\texttheta}(F) of an unknown distribution F have limiting chi-square distributions and may be used to obtain tests or confidence intervals in a way that is completely analogous to that used with parametric likelihoods. Our objective in this paper is twofold: first, to link estimating functions or equations and empirical likelihood; second, to develop methods of combining information about parameters. We do this by assuming that information about F and {\texttheta} is available in the form of unbiased estimating functions. Empirical likelihoods for parameters are developed and shown to have properties similar to those for parametric likelihood. Efficiency results for estimates of both {\texttheta} and F are obtained. The methods are illustrated on several problems, and areas for future investigation are noted.},

The quality assessment of the registry data was conducted using traditional demographic and death distribution methods, and death probabilities were calculated using life-table concepts.Results: The results show a considerable improvement in the completeness of the death-count coverage in Brazil since 1980. In the southeast and south, we observed the complete coverage of the adult mortality registry, which did not occur in the previous decade. In the northeast and north, there were still places with a low coverage from 2000 to 2010, although there was a clear improvement in the quality of data. For all Brazilian states, there was a decline in the probability of adult mortality; we observed, however, that the death probability for males is much higher than that for females throughout the whole analysis period.Conclusion: The observed improvements seem to be related to investments in the public health care system and administrative procedures to improve the recording of vital events.Keywords:~Brazil; Mortality; Demography; Underregistration}

Such forecasts would be an input to the production of probabilistic population projections for all countries, which is currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950--1995 and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 \% less than the current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in the sense that, for example, the 80 \% prediction intervals contained the truth about 80 \% of the time. We illustrate our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South Asia, a region with eight countries. Free, publicly available R software packages called bayesLife and bayesDem are available to implement the method.},

The application of the methods to estimating the stock abundance of Northeastern Atlantic minke whales, where the ratio is a raw estimate divided by a measure of observation efficiency, is explained and discussed. The Bayesian approach allows exact inference in quite general situations using only a single, rapidly implemented, one-dimensional numerical integration. A simple analytic approximation is given for the common situation where the joint posterior distribution of the numerator and denominator can be approximated by a normal distribution that gives very little probability to negative values of the denominator.

  abstract = {The randomized response technique appears to have been an innovative and useful procedure for eliciting reliable responses from individuals on sensitive or embarrassing questions. In this paper a new and alternative method is proposed for the same problem. Through the use of supplemented block, (v, k, r, b. {$\lambda$}) balanced incomplete block, and spring balance weighing designs, the individual is required to give a total of the responses to k questions, sensitive or not. From these block totals it is possible to obtain estimated responses for each of the v questions used in the survey, yet not obtain individual response to single questions. Anonymity of response for a single interviewee is thus maintained. Estimators and their variances for the estimated responses are obtained. The method allows the surveyor to obtain answers to several sensitive questions without being unduly time-consuming.},

Using the time at which an individual is identified (e.g., when illness symptoms appear) as a marker for being infected, the probabilities of becoming infected from the community or from a single infectious household member are estimated for various risk factor levels. Maximum likelihood procedures for estimating the model parameters are given. An individual may be classified with regard to level of susceptibility and level of infectiousness. The model is fitted to a combination of symptom and viral culture data from a rhinovirus epidemic in Tecumseh, Michigan. In general, it is observed that decreasing risk of infection is associated with increasing age.},

In this paper, I will provide a brief overview of probability sampling methods first and then discuss some recent methods, based on models for the non-probability samples, which could lead to useful inferences from a non-probability sample by itself or when combined with a probability sample. I will also explain how big data may be used as predictors in small area estimation, a topic of current interest because of the growing demand for reliable local area statistics.},

  abstract = {Methods for standard errors and confidence intervals for nonlinear statistics {\^{\texttheta}}--such as ratios, regression, and correlation coefficients--have been extensively studied for stratified multistage designs in which the clusters are sampled with replacement, in particular, the important special case of two sampled clusters per stratum. These methods include the customary linearization (or Taylor) method and resampling methods based on the jackknife and balanced repeated replication (BRR). Unlike the jackknife or the BRR, the linearization method is applicable to general sampling designs, but it involves a separate variance formula for each nonlinear statistic, thereby requiring additional programming efforts. Both the jackknife and the BRR use a single variance formula for all nonlinear statistics, but they are more computing-intensive. The resampling methods developed here retain these features of the jackknife and the BRR, yet permit extension to more complex designs involving sampling without replacement. The sampling designs studied include (a) stratified cluster sampling in which the clusters are sampled with replacement, (b) stratified simple random sampling without replacement, (c) unequal probability sampling without replacement, and (d) two-stage cluster sampling with equal probabilities and without replacement. Our proposed resampling methods may be viewed as extensions to complex survey samples of the bootstrap, and in the case of design (c), of the BRR as well. We obtain and study the properties of variance estimators of {\^{\texttheta}} and confidence intervals for the parameter of interest {\texttheta}, based on the bootstrap histogram of the t statistic. The variance estimators reduce to the standard ones in the special case of linear statistics. These confidence intervals take account of the skewness in the distribution of {\^{\texttheta}}, unlike the intervals based on the normal approximation. For case (a), the sampled clusters are resampled in each stratum independently by simple random sampling with replacement, and this procedure is replicated many times. The estimate for each resampled cluster is properly scaled such that the resulting variance estimator of {\^{\texttheta}} reduces to the standard unbiased variance estimator in the linear case. For case (b), the sampled units are resampled in each stratum as in case (a), but a different scaling is used. Different resampling procedures and scalings are employed for case (c). A two-stage resampling procedure is developed for case (d). Results of a simulation study under a stratified simple random design show that the bootstrap intervals track the nomial error rate in each tail better than the intervals based on the normal approximation, but the bootstrap variance estimators are less stable than those based on the linearization or the jackknife.}

  abstract = {Objectives:  The size of active network (C) of Iranian population is a very important parameter to estimate the size of unknown population using Network Scale Up (NSU) technique. However, there is little information about this parameter not only in Iran but also in other countries in Middle East region. Based on these needs, the aim of this paper is to estimate C for the Iranian population.  Methods:  Based on available national statistics, 23 reference groups, with known population sizes were selected. Using multistage sampling method, 7454 individuals were recruited randomly around the country. We asked from our samples how many people they knew from each of the reference groups. Using NSU formulae, we maximized the goodness of fit of our estimation about the size of the reference groups by fitting the best C. However, the final C was set by excluding some of the reference groups with no added information; these inappropriate groups were selected by two techniques; regression, and ratio based approaches.  Results:  Applying regression and ratio based approaches the estimated C was 308 and 380 respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the real and estimated size of reference groups (based on our C) in both methods was above 0.95. However, results of ratio based had better performance. We saw that the network of males, singles, younger age groups, and those with higher education was larger than those in other groups.  Conclusion:  It seems that C in Iran is higher than that in developed countries, possibly because of its social structure. Because of cultural and social similarities in Middle East courtiers, C in other countries also might be higher than that in developed countries.},

As of 2004 this database recorded 37 million persons at these ages, including 130,000 centenarians (more than double the number in 1990). For men, the probability of surviving from age 80 to age 90 has risen from 12 percent in 1950 to 26 percent in 2002; for women, the increase has been from 16 percent to 38 percent. In the lowest-mortality country, Japan, life expectancy at age 80 in 2006 is estimated to be 6.5 years for men and 11.3 years for women. For selected countries, average annual percent declines in age-specific death rates over the preceding ten years are calculated for single-year age groups 80 to 99 and the years 1970 to 2004. The results are presented in Lexis maps showing the patterns of change in old-age mortality by cohort and period, and separately for men and women. The trends are not favorable in all countries: for example, old-age mortality in the United States has stagnated since 1980. But countries with exceptionally low mortality, like Japan and France, do not show a deceleration in death rate declines. It is argued that life expectancy at advanced ages may continue to increase at the same pace as in the past.},

To account for this shortcoming in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), an 11-point scale was developed to code high school senior class yearbook photographs of WLS participants for relative body mass (RBM). Our analyses show that although imperfect, the RBM scale is reliable ({$\alpha$} = .91) and meets several criteria of validity as a measure of body mass. Measured at ages 17--18, the standardized relative body mass index (SRBMI) was moderately correlated (r = .31) with body mass index (BMI) at ages 53--54 and with maximum BMI reported between ages 16 and 30 (r = .48). Overweight adolescents ({$\geq$} 90th percentile of SRBMI) were about three times more likely than healthy-weight adolescents (10th--80th percentile of SRBMI) to be obese in adulthood and, as a likely consequence, significantly more likely to report health problems such as chest pain and diabetes. Overweight adolescents also suffered a twofold risk of premature death from all nonaccidental causes as well as a fourfold risk of heart disease mortality. The RBM scale has removed a serious obstacle to obesity research and lifelong analyses of health in the WLS. We suggest that other longitudinal studies may also be able to obtain photos of participants at younger ages and thus gain a prospectively useful substitute for direct measures of body mass.},

  abstract = {Probability-based sampling is the gold standard for general population surveys. However, when interested in more specific populations (e.g., consumers of a particular brand), a lot of research uses data from non-probability-based online panels. This article investigates different ways to select a sample in an opt-in panel: without previous information, using profiling information, or using passive data from a tracker installed on the panelists' devices. Moreover, it investigates the effect of sending the survey closer to the "moment-of-truth," which is expected to reduce memory limitations in recall questions. Using additional information (profiling or passive) to select the sample leads to clear improvements in terms of levels of participation and fieldwork efficiency, but not in terms of data quality (measured by the proportion of don't know answers and the length of answers to open narrative questions) or accuracy (measured by comparing the answers to 14 questions to an external source of information). Doing the survey closer to the "moment-of-truth" further improves the fieldwork efficiency; however, there are still many challenges to implement true "in-the-moment" surveys. We also observed differences across the different samples in respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and in the survey evaluation.},

Research has consistently shown that free recall name generators entail recall bias and result in missing data that affect the quality of social network data. This study describes a mixed methods approach for collecting social network data, combining a free recall name generator in the context of an online survey with network relations data coded from transcripts of semistructured qualitative interviews. The combined network provides substantially more information about the network space, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Although network density was relatively stable across networks generated from different data collection methodologies, there were noticeable differences in centrality and component structure across networks. The approach presented here involved limited participant burden and generated more complete data than either technique alone could provide. We make suggestions for further development of this method.},

  abstract = {Mortality data provide essential evidence on the health status of populations in crisis-affected and resource-poor settings and to guide and assess relief operations. Retrospective surveys are commonly used to collect mortality data in such populations, but require substantial resources and have important methodological limitations. We evaluated the feasibility of an alternative method for rapidly quantifying mortality (the informant method). The study objective was to assess the economic feasibility of the informant method. The informant method captures deaths through an exhaustive search for all deaths occurring in a population over a defined and recent recall period, using key community informants and next-of-kin of decedents. Between July and October 2008, we implemented and evaluated the informant method in: Kabul, Afghanistan; Mae La camp for Karen refugees, Thai-Burma border; Chiradzulu District, Malawi; and Lugufu and Mtabila refugee camps, Tanzania. We documented the time and cost inputs for the informant method in each site, and compared these with projections for hypothetical retrospective mortality surveys implemented in the same site with a 6 month recall period and with a 30 day recall period. The informant method was estimated to require an average of 29\% less time inputs and 33\% less monetary inputs across all four study sites when compared with retrospective surveys with a 6 month recall period, and 88\% less time inputs and 86\% less monetary inputs when compared with retrospective surveys with a 1 month recall period. Verbal autopsy questionnaires were feasible and efficient, constituting only 4\% of total person-time for the informant method's implementation in Chiradzulu District. The informant method requires fewer resources and incurs less respondent burden. The method's generally impressive feasibility and the near real-time mortality data it provides warrant further work to develop the method given the importance of mortality measurement in such settings.}

The possible ties among nodes of a network are regarded as random variables, and assumptions about dependencies among these random tie variables determine the general form of the exponential random graph model for the network. Examples of different dependence assumptions and their associated models are given, including Bernoulli, dyad-independent and Markov random graph models. The incorporation of actor attributes in social selection models is also reviewed. Newer, more complex dependence assumptions are briefly outlined. Estimation procedures are discussed, including new methods for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We foreshadow the discussion taken up in other papers in this special edition: that the homogeneous Markov random graph models of Frank and Strauss [Frank, O., Strauss, D., 1986. Markov graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 81, 832--842] are not appropriate for many observed networks, whereas the new model specifications of Snijders et al.

Methods: We compared predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths between disproportionally Latino counties ( 17.8\% Latino population) and all other counties through May 11, 2020. Adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated binomial regression models. Results: COVID-19 diagnoses rates were greater in Latino counties nationally (90.9 vs. 82.0 per 100,000). In multivariable analysis, COVID-19 cases were greater in Northeastern and Midwestern Latino counties (aRR: 1.42, 95\% CI: 1.11e1.84, and aRR: 1.70, 95\% CI: 1.57e1.85, respectively). COVID-19 deaths were greater in Midwestern Latino counties (aRR: 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.04e1.34). COVID-19 diagnoses were associated with counties with greater monolingual Spanish speakers, employment rates, heart disease deaths, less social distancing, and days since the first reported case. COVID-19 deaths were associated with household occupancy density, air pollution, employment, days since the first reported case, and age (fewer {$<$}35 yo). Conclusions: COVID-19 risks and deaths among Latino populations differ by region. Structural factors place Latino populations and particularly monolingual Spanish speakers at elevated risk for COVID-19 acquisition.},

We employ the NHANES Linked Mortality File, a large nationally representative prospective data set that includes an extensive number of factors thought to be important in mediating the education--mortality association. We find that educational differences in mortality for the total population and for specific causes of death are most prominently explained by family income and health behaviors. However, there are age-related differences in the effects of the mediating factors. Higher education enables individuals to effectively coalesce and leverage their diverse and substantial resources to reduce their mortality and increase their longevity.},

  abstract = {Web crawling, snowball sampling, and respondent-driven sampling (RDS) are three types of network driven sampling techniques that are popular when it is difficult to contact individuals in the population of interest. This paper studies network driven sampling as a Markov process on the social network that is indexed by a tree. Each node in this tree corresponds to an observation and each edge in the tree corresponds to a referral. Indexing with a tree, instead of a chain, allows for the sampled units to refer multiple future units into the sample. In survey sampling, the design effect characterizes the additional variance induced by a novel sampling strategy. If the design effect is DE, then constructing an estimator from the novel design makes the variance of the estimator DE times greater than it would be under a simple random sample. Under certain assumptions on the referral tree, the design effect of network driven sampling has a critical threshold that is a function of the referral rate \$m\$ and the clustering structure in the social network, represented by the second eigenvalue of the Markov transition matrix, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_2\$. If \$m {$<$} 1/{\textbackslash}lambda\_2{\textasciicircum}2\$, then the design effect is finite (i.e. the standard estimator is \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\$-consistent). However, if \$m {$>$} 1/{\textbackslash}lambda\_2{\textasciicircum}2\$, then the design effect grows with \$n\$ (i.e. the standard estimator is no longer \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\$-consistent). Past the critical threshold, the estimator converges at the slower rate of \${\textbackslash}log\_m {\textbackslash}lambda\_2\$. The Markov model allows for nodes to be resampled. Under certain conditions, the rate of resampling is not affected by the critical threshold, so long as \$n = o({\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\})\$, where \$n\$ is the sample size and \$N\$ is the population size.},

  abstract = {The concept of the force of natural selection was developed to explain the evolution of ageing. After ageing, however, comes a period in which mortality rates plateau and some individual organisms could, in theory, live forever. This late--life immortality has no presently agreed upon explanation. Two main theories have been offered. The first is heterogeneity within ageing cohorts, such that only extremely robust individuals survive ageing. This theory can be tested by comparisons of more and less robust cohorts. It can also be tested by fitting survival data to its models. The second theory is that late--life plateaus in mortality reflect the inevitable late--life plateau in the force of natural selection. This theory can be tested by changing the force of natural selection in evolving laboratory populations, particularly the age at which the force plateaus. This area of research has great potential for elucidating the overall structure of life--history evolution, particularly the interrelationship between the three life--history phases of development, ageing and immortality.}

  abstract = {When studying sensitive issues, including corruption, prejudice, and sexual behavior, researchers have increasingly relied upon indirect questioning techniques to mitigate such known problems of direct survey questions as underreporting and nonresponse. However, there have been surprisingly few empirical validation studies of these indirect techniques because the information required to verify the resulting estimates is often difficult to access. This article reports findings from the first comprehensive validation study of indirect methods. We estimate whether people voted for an anti-abortion referendum held during the 2011 Mississippi General Election using direct questioning and three popular indirect methods: list experiment, endorsement experiment, and randomized response. We then validate these estimates against the official election outcome. While direct questioning leads to significant underestimation of sensitive votes against the referendum, indirect survey techniques yield estimates much closer to the actual vote count, with endorsement experiment and randomized response yielding the least bias.},

  abstract = {Data on abortion in sub-Saharan Africa are rare and non-representative. This study presents a new method to collect quantitative data on clandestine abortion, the confidants method, applied in 2001 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Preliminary qualitative work showed that individuals are aware of their close friends' induced abortions: women usually talk to their peers about the unintended pregnancy and ask them for help in locating illegal abortion providers. In a survey of 963 women of reproductive age representative of the city of Ouagadougou, we asked respondents to list their close relations, and, for each of them, and for each of the 5 years preceding the survey, whether they had an induced abortion. According to these data, there are 40 induced abortions per 1000 women aged 15-49 in Ouagadougou annually, and 60 per 1000 women aged 15-19. Adverse health consequences followed 60\% of the reported induced abortions, and 14\% of them received treatment in a hospital. Extrapolating these results to the entire city, we estimate that its hospitals treat about 1000 cases of abortion complications a year. Hospital data indicate that these centers admitted 984 induced abortions (adding all "certainly", "probably" and "possibly" induced abortions in the WHO protocol) in 2001; the age distribution of patients admitted for induced abortion also corresponds to the confidants method's projections ("certainly" induced abortions only). At least two biases could affect the abortion rates estimated by the confidants method, pertaining to the selection of the sample of relations and to the varying number of third parties involved in the abortion process. The confidants method, which is similar in its principle to the sisterhood method used to estimate maternal mortality levels, might generate accurate estimates of illegal abortion in certain contexts if these two biases are controlled for. Further testing is necessary.},

Migrants from Middle Eastern countries (relative risk (RR)~=~3.2, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.6, 3.8), Africa (RR~=~3.0, 95\% CI: 2.2, 4.3), and non-Sweden Nordic countries (RR~=~1.5, 95\% CI: 1.2, 1.8) had higher mortality from COVID-19 than persons born in Sweden. Especially high mortality risks from COVID-19 were found among persons born in Somalia, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. Socioeconomic status, number of working-age household members, and neighborhood population density attenuated up to half of the increased COVID-19 mortality risks among the foreign-born.

The present study addressed how the associations between social network characteristics and mortality differ across race and ethnicity in later life.Data were from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. At baseline, 3005 respondents were interviewed with regards to their health and social networks. Five years later, 430 respondents had died. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of all-cause mortality over the study period.Network size and kin composition were negatively associated with mortality, whereas density was positively associated with mortality. There was a stronger negative association between the kin composition and mortality for Hispanic respondents compared with white and Black respondents.The present study contributes to the large literature documenting the link between social networks and health by highlighting the importance of analyzing networks through a sociocultural lens.}

  abstract = {The debate around vaccine prioritization for COVID-19 has revolved around balancing the benefits from: (1) the direct protection conferred by the vaccine amongst those at highest risk of severe disease outcomes, and (2) the indirect protection through vaccinating those that are at highest risk of being infected and of transmitting the virus. While adults aged 65+ are at highest risk for severe disease and death from COVID-19, essential service and other in-person workers with greater rates of contact may be at higher risk of acquiring and transmitting SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, there have been relatively little data available to understand heterogeneity in contact rates and risk across these demographic groups. Here, we retrospectively analyze and evaluate vaccination prioritization strategies by age and worker status. We use a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and uniquely detailed contact data collected as part of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey to evaluate five vaccination prioritization strategies: (1) prioritizing only adults over age 65, (2) prioritizing only high-contact workers, (3) splitting prioritization between adults 65+ and high-contact workers, (4) tiered prioritization of adults over age 65 followed by high-contact workers, and (5) tiered prioritization of high-contact workers followed by adults. We find that for the primary two-dose vaccination schedule, assuming 70\% uptake, a tiered roll-out that first prioritizes adults 65+ averts the most deaths (31\% fewer deaths compared to a no-vaccination scenario) while a tiered roll-out that prioritizes high contact workers averts the most number of clinical infections (14\% fewer clinical infections compared to a no-vaccination scenario). We also consider prioritization strategies for booster doses during a subsequent outbreak of a hypothetical new SARS-CoV-2 variant. We find that a tiered roll-out that prioritizes adults 65+ for booster doses consistently averts the most deaths, and it may also avert the most number of clinical cases depending on the epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 variant and the vaccine efficacy.},

It is argued that finite populations do fall within the scope of this axiom, and that the likelihood function, when properly defined and interpreted, can play the same fundamental role in finite population theory as it does elsewhere in statistical inference. Under a multivariate normal regression model, the relationship between the likelihood function for the population total and the probability distribution of the minimum variance unbiased estimator is studied. The anticipated result, that this estimator maximizes the likelihood function, is shown to hold under the most familiar models, but an example shows it to be false in general. The role of balanced samples in providing robust inferences is discussed briefly. Conditions are described under which the likelihood function is unchanged by the addition of a new regressor to the model.},

On the other hand, to demonstrate more broadly how sampling can impact the estimation of relevant network properties like centrality measures different than the one aimed at optimizing, community structure and node attribute distribution. In addition, we analyze sampling behaviors in various instances of network generative models. Finally, we adapt the theoretical framework behind TCEC for the case of PageRank centrality and propose a sampling algorithm aimed at optimizing its estimation. We show that, while the theoretical derivation can be suitably adapted to cover this case, the resulting algorithm suffers of a high computational complexity that requires further approximations compared to the eigenvector centrality case. Main contributions (a) Extensive empirical analysis of the impact of the TCEC sampling method (optimized for eigenvector centrality recovery) on different centrality measures, community structure, node attributes and statistics related to specific network generative models; (b) extending TCEC to optimize PageRank estimation.},

Here the authors find that inferences of power from photos of the faces of the managing partners of America's top 100 law firms significantly corresponded to their success as leaders, as measured by the amounts of profits that their firms earned. More interesting, this relationship was also observed when judgments were made based on photos of the leaders taken from their undergraduate yearbooks, before they began their careers or entered law school. Facial cues to success may therefore be consistent across much of the lifespan (approximately 20--50 years).},

The techniques of the jackknife, balanced repeated replication (balanced half-samples), and the bootstrap are described, and the properties of these methods are summarized.

The conceptual scheme is used to describe a set of inescapable features of intergroup and intragroup relations. We examine, both qualitatively and formal equations, the tautologies that govern contact rates and network densities for any population that can be divided into two categories. We show how assumptions about the partitioning of populations into social categories can be translated into precise probabilities of contact within and between categories. We present several illustrations of the immodest implications of apparently modest assumptions. Following simulations of a high school within an adult community and an old boy network within a larger bureaucracy, we apply our conceptual scheme to actual data on social relations within a regional elite. Accompanying these examples is a discussion of new perspective on reference groups, as well as a development of a common exception to Blau's theory. We conclude with a formal statement of the substantive propositions that follow from our conceptual scheme.}

  abstract = {The bipartite record linkage task consists of merging two disparate datafiles containing information on two overlapping sets of entities. This is nontrivial in the absence of unique identifiers and it is important for a wide variety of applications given that it needs to be solved whenever we have to combine information from different sources. Most statistical techniques currently used for record linkage are derived from a seminal article by Fellegi and Sunter in 1969. These techniques usually assume independence in the matching statuses of record pairs to derive estimation procedures and optimal point estimators. We argue that this independence assumption is unreasonable and instead target a bipartite matching between the two datafiles as our parameter of interest. Bayesian implementations allow us to quantify uncertainty on the matching decisions and derive a variety of point estimators using different loss functions. We propose partial Bayes estimates that allow uncertain parts of the bipartite matching to be left unresolved. We evaluate our approach to record linkage using a variety of challenging scenarios and show that it outperforms the traditional methodology. We illustrate the advantages of our methods merging two datafiles on casualties from the civil war of El Salvador. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Multiple-systems or capture--recapture estimation are common techniques for population size estimation, particularly in the quantitative study of human rights violations. These methods rely on multiple samples from the population, along with the information of which individuals appear in which samples. The goal of record linkage techniques is to identify unique individuals across samples based on the information collected on them. Linkage decisions are subject to uncertainty when such information contains errors and missingness, and when different individuals have very similar characteristics. Uncertainty in the linkage should be propagated into the stage of population size estimation. We propose an approach called linkage-averaging to propagate linkage uncertainty, as quantified by some Bayesian record linkage methodologies, into a subsequent stage of population size estimation. Linkage-averaging is a two-stage approach in which the results from the record linkage stage are fed into the population size estimation stage. We show that under some conditions the results of this approach correspond to those of a proper Bayesian joint model for both record linkage and population size estimation. The two-stage nature of linkage-averaging allows us to combine different record linkage models with different capture--recapture models, which facilitates model exploration. We present a case study from the Salvadoran civil war, where we are interested in estimating the total number of civilian killings using lists of witnesses' reports collected by different organizations. These lists contain duplicates, typographical and spelling errors, missingness, and other inaccuracies that lead to uncertainty in the linkage. We show how linkage-averaging can be used for transferring the uncertainty in the linkage of these lists into different models for population size estimation.},

This phenomenon lacks an explanation in countries where vaccination rates are rising on an already high level. Here, we build on the growing evidence that belief systems, rather than access to vaccines, are the primary barrier to vaccination in high-income countries, and show how a simple opinion formation process can lead to clusters of unvaccinated individuals, leading to a dramatic increase in disease outbreak probability. In particular, the effect of clustering on outbreak probabilities is strongest when the vaccination coverage is close to the level required to provide herd immunity under the assumption of random mixing. Our results based on computer simulations suggest that the current estimates of vaccination coverage necessary to avoid outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases might be too low.},

Despite the importance of this transmission route, very little is known about the dynamic patterns of CPIs. Using wireless sensor network technology, we obtained high-resolution data of CPIs during a typical day at an American high school, permitting the reconstruction of the social network relevant for infectious disease transmission. At 94\% coverage, we collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal distance of 3 m among 788 individuals. The data revealed a high-density network with typical small-world properties and a relatively homogeneous distribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects. Computer simulations of the spread of an influenza-like disease on the weighted contact graph are in good agreement with absentee data during the most recent influenza season. Analysis of targeted immunization strategies suggested that contact network data are required to design strategies that are significantly more effective than random immunization. Immunization strategies based on contact network data were most effective at high vaccination coverage.},

Thus, the authors empirically assessed a promising new method for estimating the sizes of most at-risk populations: the network scale-up method. Using 4 different data sources, 2 of which were from other researchers, the authors produced 5 estimates of the number of heavy drug users in Curitiba, Brazil. The authors found that the network scale-up and generalized network scale-up estimators produced estimates 5--10 times higher than estimates made using standard methods (the multiplier method and the direct estimation method using data from 2004 and 2010). Given that equally plausible methods produced such a wide range of results, the authors recommend that additional studies be undertaken to compare estimates based on the scale-up method with those made using other methods. If scale-up-based methods routinely produce higher estimates, this would suggest that scale-up-based methods are inappropriate for populations most at risk of HIV/AIDS or that standard methods may tend to underestimate the sizes of these populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Estimating the sizes of hard-to-count populations is a challenging and important problem that occurs frequently in social science, public health, and public policy. This problem is particularly pressing in HIV/AIDS research because estimates of the sizes of the most at-risk populations--illicit drug users, men who have sex with men, and sex workers--are needed for designing, evaluating, and funding programs to curb the spread of the disease. A promising new approach in this area is the network scale-up method, which uses information about the personal networks of respondents to make population size estimates. However, if the target population has low social visibility, as is likely to be the case in HIV/AIDS research, scale-up estimates will be too low. In this paper we develop a game-like activity that we call the game of contacts in order to estimate the social visibility of groups, and report results from a study of heavy drug users in Curitiba, Brazil (n = 294). The game produced estimates of social visibility that were consistent with qualitative expectations but of surprising magnitude. Further, a number of checks suggest that the data are high-quality. While motivated by the specific problem of population size estimation, our method could be used by researchers more broadly and adds to long-standing efforts to combine the richness of social network analysis with the power and scale of sample surveys.},

Here we use an outbreak of chikungunya as a case study where detailed epidemiological data were collected and combine it with statistical approaches to characterize the multiple factors that influence the risk of infectious disease transmission and may depend on characteristics of the individual (e.g., age, sex), of his or her close relatives (e.g., household members), or of the wider neighborhood. Our findings highlight the role that integrating statistical approaches with in-depth information on the at-risk population can have on understanding pathogen spread.           ,              Whether an individual becomes infected in an infectious disease outbreak depends on many interconnected risk factors, which may relate to characteristics of the individual (e.g., age, sex), his or her close relatives (e.g., household members), or the wider community. Studies monitoring individuals in households or schools have helped elucidate the determinants of transmission in small social structures due to advances in statistical modeling; but such an approach has so far largely failed to consider individuals in the wider context they live in. Here, we used an outbreak of chikungunya in a rural community in Bangladesh as a case study to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of risk factors in disease spread. We developed Bayesian data augmentation approaches to account for uncertainty in the source of infection, recall uncertainty, and unobserved infection dates. We found that the probability of chikungunya transmission was 12\% [95\% credible interval (CI): 8--17\%] between household members but dropped to 0.3\% for those living 50 m away (95\% CI: 0.2--0.5\%). Overall, the mean transmission distance was 95 m (95\% CI: 77--113 m). Females were 1.5 times more likely to become infected than males (95\% CI: 1.2--1.8), which was virtually identical to the relative risk of being at home estimated from an independent human movement study in the country. Reported daily use of antimosquito coils had no detectable impact on transmission. This study shows how the complex interplay between the characteristics of an individual and his or her close and wider environment contributes to the shaping of infectious disease epidemics.},

  abstract = {Return on assets (ROA) of household enterprise is crucial for understanding the productivity of households in developing economies. Yet the definition and measurement of household enterprise ROA remain inconsistent or unclear. We illustrate potential measurement problems with examples from various surveys. We take advantage of a detailed household survey and analyze what matters and for whom. The three issues that matter most for measurement of household enterprise ROA are the choice of accrual versus cash income, the treatment of household labor in enterprise income, and the treatment of non-factor income. This sensitivity matters most for a poorer region dominated by cultivation relative to a richer region with non-farm enterprises. Though the choice between accrued and cash income matters less when the frequency of the data declines, there remains high sensitivity in annualized data. We provide recommendations on how to improve the survey questionnaires for more accurate measurement in field research.},

  abstract = {City elections in the U.S. are widely thought to be low-information contests decided by non-ideological factors. This consensus casts doubt on the possibility of electoral accountability in cities, and renders recent evidence of municipal responsiveness puzzling. However, our knowledge of how voters actually behave in local elections is severely limited by a lack of individual-level survey data collected from local contests. Using three such original surveys, I re-examine the role of ideology in mayoral elections, recruiting samples of local voters via geotargeted Facebook advertisements. In two large cities, I find ideology is a powerful and independent predictor of vote choice. Using a panel design, I find voters learn the relative ideological positions of candidates over the course of a campaign, and that learning causally impacts vote choice. The effect of ideology also replicates in a conjoint experiment fielded to a sample of small-city voters in another region. Electoral accountability is thus a plausible explanation for ideological responsiveness in U.S. cities, and the methodological tools introduced here can now be applied to a variety of questions about local voter behavior.},

The same feature has been decried by non-researchers concerned about potential racial discrimination and foreign influence in elections. The extent to which these ads actually reach their targets, however, is unknown. Using a series of six surveys and 20 targeted ads, I show these ads regularly fail to reach their targets. The success rate ranges from 23 to 99 percent, and ads targeted toward groups defined by self-reported data and broader geographic locations are generally more successful.},

The primary objective of this research is to study the quantitative contribution of generative systems in the description of historical sources. This is done by contextualizing the task of captioning historical photographs from the Catalan archives as a case study. Our findings provide practitioners with tools and directions on transfer learning for captioning models based on visual adaptation and linguistic proximity.},

The two approaches are compared in this paper for the problem of estimating the mean of the finite population. Following some notes on the historical development, criteria for "best estimator" within each approach are discussed. These criteria are applied to a series of examples, which show that several of the classical results can be obtained and reinterpreted without difficulty through the model-based theory. The role of "artificial randomization" is discussed. It is argued that the model-based framework often offers advantages over the design-based one when it comes to presenting a lucid argument in favor of some given sampling procedure.}

  abstract = {Around the world a multitude of surveys are conducted every day, on a variety of subjects, and consequently surveys have become an accepted part of modern life. However, in recent years survey estimates have been increasingly affected by rising trends in nonresponse, with loss of accuracy as an undesirable result. Whilst it is possible to reduce nonresponse to some degree, it cannot be completely eliminated. Estimation techniques that account systematically for nonresponse and at the same time succeed in delivering acceptable accuracy are much needed. Estimation in Surveys with Nonresponse provides an overview of these techniques, presenting the view of nonresponse as a normal (albeit undesirable) feature of a sample survey, one whose potentially harmful effects are to be minimised.  Builds in the nonresponse feature of survey data collection as an integral part of the theory, both for point estimation and for variance estimation. Promotes weighting through calibration as a new and powerful technique for surveys with nonresponse. Highlights the analysis of nonresponse bias in estimates and methods to minimize this bias. Includes computational tools to help identify the best variables for calibration. Discusses the use of imputation as a complement to weighting by calibration. Contains guidelines for dealing with frame imperfections and coverage errors. Features worked examples throughout the text, using real data.  The accessible style of Estimation in Surveys with Nonresponse will make this an invaluable tool for survey methodologists in national statistics agencies and private survey agencies. Researchers, teachers, and students of statistics, social sciences and economics will benefit from the clear presentation and numerous examples.},

  abstract = {The 1918-19 influenza epidemic killed more than fifty million people worldwide. The SARS epidemic of 2002-3, by comparison, killed fewer than a thousand. The success in containing the spread of SARS was due largely to the rapid global response of public health authorities, which was aided by insights resulting from mathematical models. Models enabled authorities to better understand how the disease spread and to assess the relative effectiveness of different control strategies. In this book, Lisa Sattenspiel and Alun Lloyd provide a comprehensive introduction to mathematical models in epidemiology and show how they can be used to predict and control the geographic spread of major infectious diseases.Key concepts in infectious disease modeling are explained, readers are guided from simple mathematical models to more complex ones, and the strengths and weaknesses of these models are explored. The book highlights the breadth of techniques available to modelers today, such as population-based and individual-based models, and covers specific applications as well. Sattenspiel and Lloyd examine the powerful mathematical models that health authorities have developed to understand the spatial distribution and geographic spread of influenza, measles, foot-and-mouth disease, and SARS. Analytic methods geographers use to study human infectious diseases and the dynamics of epidemics are also discussed. A must-read for students, researchers, and practitioners, no other book provides such an accessible introduction to this exciting and fast-evolving field.},

The web survey used a statistical technique, propensity scoring, to adjust for selection bias. Comparing the weighted responses from both surveys, there were no significant response differences in 8 of 37 questions. Web survey responses were significantly more likely to agree with RDD responses when the question asked about the respondent's personal health (9 times more likely), was a factual question (9 times more likely), and only had two as opposed to multiple response categories (17 times more likely). For three questions, significant differences turned insignificant when adjacent categories of multicategory questions were combined. Factual questions tended to also be questions with two rather than multiple response categories. More study is needed to isolate the effects of these two factors more clearly.},

  abstract = {Abortion is illegal in Burkina Faso except in cases of incest, rape, fetal defect, or when the woman's life or physical health is endangered. As a result, abortion procedures are often conducted illegally and unsafely and measuring incidence proves difficult. We estimate incidence of abortion and associated morbidity using two methodologies. The first is the Abortion Incidence Complications Method (AICM), which uses information on women hospitalized for abortion-related complications as well as health professionals' assessments of the proportion of women who seek treatment for complications from unsafe abortions. The second is the Anonymous Third Party Reporting (ATPR) method, which entails surveying women about their confidantes' abortions. We conclude that the AICM yields a more accurate result. We estimate that 87,200 abortion procedures were carried out in 2008, representing 25 for every 1,000 women aged 15--49. More than one in four procedures resulted in complications treated at a health facility. The abortion rate estimated using the ATPR approach was 72 percent of that estimated with the AICM. The ATPR method yields information on the characteristics of the women who have abortions as well as the providers and methods they use.},

Recent experimental investigations have stressed the importance of large cohorts for detecting leveling off of mortality rates at older ages. In the present study, emphasis was placed on evaluation of relatively small cohorts (about 150--300 individuals). Deaths were simulated under the assumption of the frailty mortality model. Two different parameter sets that resulted in differences in mean life span of more than twofold were used for simulations. Our smallest cohorts yielded parameter estimates that had generally good statistical properties, but relatively large standard errors. For tests of hypotheses concerning equality of parameters among populations or experimental treatments, empirical standard errors (obtained from several cohorts) were preferable to asymptotic standard errors (obtained for single cohorts). In particular, empirical standard errors yielded reliable type I error rates.},

The maternal deaths that occurred during the 15-year period from 1976 to 1990 in the Matlab DSS area are the basis of this study. A sisterhood survey was conducted in Matlab In November and December 1991 to collect information on conditions, events and symptoms that preceded death. The collected information was evaluated to assign a most likely cause of maternal death. The sisterhood survey cause of maternal death was then compared with the DSS cause of maternal death.Cause of death could not be assigned with reasonable confidence for 34 (11\%) of the 305 maternal deaths for which information was collected. For the remaining deaths, the agreement between the two classification systems was generally high for most cause-of-death categories considered.Though cause-of-death information obtained by the sisterhood method will always be subject to some error, it can provide an indication of an overall distribution of causes of maternal deaths. This data can be used for the planning of programmes aimed at reducing maternal mortality and for the evaluation of such programmes over time.}

One of the deceased woman's surviving brothers or sisters, aged 15 or older and born to the same mother, was asked if the deceased sister had died of maternity-related causes. Of the 384 maternal deaths for which siblings were interviewed, 305 deaths were correctly reported, 16 deaths were underreported, and the remaining 63 were misreported as nonmaternal deaths. Information on maternity-related deaths obtained in a sisterhood survey conducted in the Matlab DSS area was compared with the information recorded in the DSS. Results suggest that in places similar to Matlab, the sisterhood method can be used to provide an indication of the level of maternal mortality if no other data exist, though the method will produce negative bias in maternal mortality estimates.}

Economists interpret these population-level trends to indicate that despair induced by financial stressors is a shared pathway to these causes of death. Although we now have the catchy term ``deaths of despair,'' we have yet to study its central empirical claim: that conceptually defined and empirically assessed ``despair'' is indeed a common pathway to several causes of death. At the level of the person, despair consists of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and biological domains. Despair can also permeate social relationships, networks, institutions, and communities. Extant longitudinal data sets feature repeated measures of despair---before, during, and after the Great Recession---offering resources to test the role that despair induced by economic decline plays in premature morbidity and mortality. Such tests must also focus on protective factors that could shield individuals. Deaths of despair is more than a phrase; it constitutes a hypothesis that deserves conceptual mapping and empirical study with longitudinal, multilevel data.}

  annotation = {Background:  Network scale-up is an indirect method for estimating the size of hidden, hard-to-count or high risk populations. Social network size estimation is the first step in this method. The present study was conducted with the purpose of estimating the social network size of the Tehran Province residents and its determinants.    Methods  :  Maximum Likelihood Estimation was applied to estimate people's network sizes by using populations of known sizes and the scale-up method. Respondents were selected from Tehran province through convenience sampling in 2012. Out of thirteen selected subpopulations with known size, ten had minimum accuracy which used in our analysis.    Results  :  Of the 1029 respondents in this study, 46.7\% were male. The social network size of Tehran Province residents was estimated to be 259.1 (CI 95\% : 242.2, 276) based on the ten known populations remained in this study. This size was 291.8 in men and 230.4 in women. Younger people (18-25 years old) had larger network sizes compared to the other age groups ( P \&lt;0.001).    Conclusion  :  Our estimation for social network size of Tehran inhabitants was smaller than that previously estimated size for the whole country (c=380). In addition, we found that the social network of subpopulations was different. This difference means that we need local estimations for sub-populations to improve the accuracy of population size estimation using network scale up method.   ~    Keywords  :  Network scale up, Population size, Acquaintance, Social network size, Hidden population}

  abstract = {Abstract Background and aim: Various methods of estimating the size of hidden populations are prone to different degrees of information biases. This study aimed to assess such biases. Methods: We estimated the prevalence of risky behaviors using direct, modified network scale-up (NSU) and proxy respondent method (PRM) among college students. Results: The network sizes of the male and female students were 25.8 and 29.5. We found alcohol use was the most prevalent risky behaviors among males (PRM: 18.12\%, NSU: 8.68\%, direct: 13.4\%) and the extra-marital sex was the most prevalent one among females (PRM: 3.47\%, NSU: 0.95\%, direct: 1.4\%). Based on PRM, intravenous drug use (IDU) was the least prevalent behavior among college students. Conclusion: We concluded that direct and NSU methods might underestimate the results.}

Issues examined were the conditions surrounding the difficulty of knowing information about social network members, including knowledge of HIV status. The stigmatizing nature of AIDS resulted in selective knowledge regarding a person's HIV status (and other information) among their social network members. Informants' networks appeared smaller than those for other groups we have investigated, and this may be due to informant self-limiting, or alter rejection of HIV informant. These results will be useful in determining the amount of HIV + in the general population, and these methods could be applied to other hard-to-count populations.},

Clustering promoted short path lengths in all network types, but randomly assembled networks displayed a logarithmic relationship between degree and path length; whereas this response was linear in regular lattices. In all cases, small-world models, generated by rewiring the connections of a regular lattice, displayed properties, which spanned the gap between random and regular networks.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives Studies on socioeconomic health disparities often suffer from a lack of uniform data and methodology. Using high quality, census-linked data and sensible inequality measures, this study documents the changes in absolute and relative mortality differences by education in Finland, Norway and Sweden over the period 1971 to 2000. Methods The age-standardised mortality rates and the population exposures for three educational categories were computed from detailed data provided by the national statistical offices. Mortality disparities by education were assessed using two range measures (rate differences and rate ratios), and two Gini-like measures (the average inter-group difference (AID) and the Gini coefficient (G)). The formulae for the decomposition of the change in the AID into (1) the contribution of change in population composition by education, and (2) the contribution of mortality change were introduced. Results Mortality decreases were often greater for high than for medium and low education. Both relative and absolute mortality disparities tend to increase over time. The magnitude and timing of the increases in absolute disparities vary by country. Both the rate differences and the AIDs have increased since the 1970s in Norway and Sweden, and since the 1980s in Finland. The contributions of the changes in population composition to the total AID increase were substantial in all countries, and for both sexes. The mortality contributions were substantial for males in Norway and Sweden. Conclusions The study reports increases in absolute mortality disparity, and its components. This trend needs to be further studied and addressed by policies.},

  abstract = {Objective: To estimate the size of groups at high risk of HIV, Network Scale UP (NSU), an indirect method, was used. Methods: 500 Kermanian male aged 18 to 45 were recruited. 8 groups at high risk of HIV were defined: Users of opium, unknown drug, ecstasy, and alcohol; intra-venous drug users (IDUs; males who have extra-marital sex with females (MSF); male who have sex with female sex workers (MFSW); and male who have sex with other male (MSMs). We asked respondents whether they know anybody (probability method), and if yes, how many people (frequency method) in our target groups. Results: Estimates derived in the probability method were higher than the frequency method. Based on the probability method, 13.7\% (95\% CI: 11.3\%, 16.1\%) of males used alcohol at least once in last year; the corresponding percent for opium was 13.1\% (95\% CI: 10.9\%, 15.3\%). In addition, 12\% has extra-marital sex in last year (95\% CI: 10\%, 14\%); while 7\% (95\% CI: 5.8\%, 8.2\%) had sex with a female sex worker. Conclusion: We showed that drug use is more common among young and mid-age males; although their sexual contacts were also considerable. These percentages show that special preventive program is needed to control an HIV transmission. Estimates derived from probability method were comparable with data from external sources. The underestimation in frequency method might be due to the fact that respondents are not aware of sensitive characteristics of all those in their network and underreporting is likely to occur.}

Experimental evidence indicates that people willingly incur costs to help strangers in anonymous one-shot interactions, and that altruistic behaviour is motivated, at least in part, by empathy and concern for the welfare of others (hereafter referred to as other-regarding preferences). In contrast, cooperative behaviour in non-human primates is mainly limited to kin and reciprocating partners, and is virtually never extended to unfamiliar individuals. Here we present experimental tests of the existence of other-regarding preferences in non-human primates, and show that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) do not take advantage of opportunities to deliver benefits to familiar individuals at no material cost to themselves, suggesting that chimpanzee behaviour is not motivated by other-regarding preferences. Chimpanzees are among the primates most likely to demonstrate prosocial behaviours. They participate in a variety of collective activities, including territorial patrols, coalitionary aggression, cooperative hunting, food sharing and joint mate guarding. Consolation of victims of aggression and anecdotal accounts of solicitous treatment of injured individuals suggest that chimpanzees may feel empathy. Chimpanzees sometimes reject exchanges in which they receive less valuable rewards than others, which may be one element of a 'sense of fairness', but there is no evidence that they are averse to interactions in which they benefit more than others.},

The UK Government published an estimate of 10,000 to 13,000 victims, constructed by the present author, as part of the strategy leading to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This estimate was obtained by a stepwise multiple systems method based on six lists. Further investigation shows that a small proportion of the possible models give rather different answers, and that other model fitting approaches may choose one of these. Three data sets collected in the field of modern slavery, together with a data set about the death toll in the Kosovo conflict, are used to investigate the stability and robustness of various multiple systems estimate methods. The crucial aspect is the way that interactions between lists are modelled, because these can substantially affect the results. Model selection and Bayesian approaches are considered in detail, in particular to assess their stability and robustness when applied to real modern slavery data. A new Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian approach is developed; overall, this gives robust and stable results at least for the examples considered. The software and datasets are freely and publicly available to facilitate wider implementation and further research.},

  abstract = {In complex survey data, often the sampling design induces a non-iid structure to the data (e.g., without replacement sampling, stratification, multistage, or unequal probability of selection). Though techniques for variance estimation and confidence intervals do exist, they often are cumbersome to implement or do not extend to complex designs. It would be desirable to have resampling methods that reuse the existing estimation system repeatedly, using computing power to avoid theoretical work, and that can be applied to such data. In recognition of this need, various resampling procedures for variance estimation and confidence intervals in sample survey data (where the sampling is without replacement) have been proposed in the literature. These include the jackknife, the with-replacement bootstrap (BWR), the without-replacement bootstrap (BWO), and the rescaling bootstrap. The BWR and BWO are applicable only to simple sampling designs. Others have shown the asymptotic consistency of jackknife variance estimates for nonlinear functions of means for multistage designs in which the primary sampling units are selected with replacement. However, when the primary sampling units are selected without replacement, the jackknife has been developed only for stratified sampling. The rescaling bootstrap extends to more complex sampling designs, but is applicable only to functions of means and can be computationally more intensive and difficult to use. The resampling method developed in this article retains the desirable properties of the BWR and BWO, but extends to more complex without-replacement sampling designs: (a) stratified random sampling, (b) two-stage cluster sampling, and (c) the Rao-Hartley-Cochran method of unequal probability sampling. The method consists of resampling without replacement from the data vector to mirror the original sampling design and then repeating this with replacement to match the usual variance estimates in the linear case. In the simple sampling designs to which the BWR is applicable, this resampling method contains the BWR as a special case and consequently suggests an extension of the BWR to two-stage cluster sampling. The properties of the variance estimators of {\^{\texttheta}} and the bootstrap-t confidence intervals for {\texttheta} are studied. The variance estimator is shown to be consistent when {\^{\texttheta}} is a nonlinear function of means, in situation (a). The confidence intervals are shown to capture the second-order term of the Edgeworth expansion of the distribution of {\=y} in situation (a) and thus account for skewness in the distribution. A simulation study for situation (a) suggests that the confidence intervals from the method track the nominal one-tailed error rates better than do the normal theory intervals, but the variance estimates are less stable. For the median, the method generally performs very well.}

  abstract = {Objectives: Social capital has been linked to self rated health and mortality rates. The authors examined the relations between measures of social capital and male/female mortality rates across counties in Hungary. Design: Cross sectional, ecological study. Setting: 20 counties of Hungary. Participants and methods: 12 640 people were interviewed in 1995 (the ``Hungarostudy II'' survey), representing the Hungarian population according to sex, age, and county. Social capital was measured by three indicators: lack of social trust, reciprocity between citizens, and help received from civil organisations. Covariates included county GDP, personal income, education, unemployment, smoking, and alcohol spirit consumption. Main outcome measure: Gender specific mortality rates were calculated for the middle aged population (45--64 years) in the 20 counties of Hungary. Results: All of the social capital variables were significantly associated with middle age mortality, but levels of mistrust showed the strongest association. Several gender differences were observed, namely male mortality rates were more closely associated with lack of help from civic organisations, while female mortality rates were more closely connected with perceptions of reciprocity. Conclusion: There are gender differences in the relations of specific social capital indicators to mortality rates. At the same time, perceptions of social capital within each sex were associated with mortality rates in the opposite sex.},

  abstract = {In animal models, single-gene mutations in genes involved in insulin/IGF and target of rapamycin signalling pathways extend lifespan to a considerable extent. The genetic, genomic and epigenetic influences on human longevity are expected to be much more complex. Strikingly however, beneficial metabolic and cellular features of long-lived families resemble those in animals for whom the lifespan is extended by applying genetic manipulation and, especially, dietary restriction. Candidate gene studies in humans support the notion that human orthologues from longevity genes identified in lower species do contribute to longevity but that the influence of the genetic variants involved is small. Here we discuss how an integration of novel study designs, labour-intensive biobanking, deep phenotyping and genomic research may provide insights into the mechanisms that drive human longevity and healthy ageing, beyond the associations usually provided by molecular and genetic epidemiology. Although prospective studies of humans from the cradle to the grave have never been performed, it is feasible to extract life histories from different cohorts jointly covering the molecular changes that occur with age from early development all the way up to the age at death. By the integration of research in different study cohorts, and with research in animal models, biological research into human longevity is thus making considerable progress.},

  abstract = {Disease transmission and behaviour change are both fundamentally social phenomena. Behaviour change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favour the more rapid adoption of behavioural innovations. We analyse a simple model of coupled behaviour change and infection in a structured population characterised by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioural divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behaviour-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a `second wave' in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarised populations such as the USA.},

  abstract = {When people are facing difficulties, they often feel the need for a confidant-a person to vent to or a sympathetic ear with whom to talk things through. How do they decide on whom to rely? In theory, the answer seems obvious: if the matter is personal, they will turn to a spouse, a family member, or someone close. In practice, what people actually do often belies these expectations. In Someone To Talk To, Mario Luis Small follows a group of graduate students as they cope with stress, overwork, self-doubt, failure, relationships, children, health care, and poverty. He unravels how they decide whom to turn to for support. And he then confirms his findings based on representative national data on adult Americans. Small shows that rather than consistently relying on their "strong ties," Americans often take pains to avoid close friends and family, as these relationships are both complex and fraught with expectations. In contrast, they often confide in "weak ties," as the need for understanding or empathy trumps their fear of misplaced trust. In fact, people may find themselves confiding in acquaintances and even strangers unexpectedly, without having reflected on the consequences. Someone To Talk To reveals the often counter-intuitive nature of social support, helping us understand when people will keep depression secret from their close ones, why people may avoid reporting sexual assault, how people may decide whom to come out to, and why even competitors can be among a person's best confidants. Amid a growing wave of big data and large-scale network analysis, Small returns to the basic questions of whom we connect with, how, and why, upending decades of conventional wisdom on how we should think about and analyze social networks.},

Our study was based on a complete network study design that allowed for the analysis of reporting accuracy in contact diary studies. We collected contact data of the employees of three research groups over a period of 1 work week. We found that more than one third of all reported contacts were only reported by one out of the two involved contact partners. Non-reporting is most frequent in cases of short, non-intense contact. We estimated that the probability of forgetting a contact of {$\leq$}5 min duration is greater than 50\%. Furthermore, the number of forgotten contacts appears to be proportional to the total number of contacts.},

  abstract = {The scale-up estimator is a network-based estimator for the size of hidden or hard to count subpopulations. Several issues arise in the public health context when the aim is the estimation of injuries occurring in a certain population, where two common problems are present: (a) Small injuries are usually difficult to observe and rarely reported in the official data and (b) people are not always compliant in giving information about some specific injuries, in particular when children are involved. This study checked the methodological issues arising from using a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey using the scale-up methodology for detecting the number of injuries due to choking in children ages 0 to 14 in Italy. For this purpose, 1,000 CATI interviews were conducted during a week using a questionnaire based on 33 questions about populations of known size according to census data. Then, each respondent was asked about other questions related to the main target population (e.g., number of children known to suffer from a choking accident). A sensitivity analysis was conducted for estimating the effect of varying subpopulations, order of the questions, and interviewer effects on the resulting estimates. For the interviewer effect, no particular differences were observed in the overall estimates of injuries. The conclusion is the scale-up estimator in association with CATI methodology shows a high potential in the field of injury prevention, being accurate and robust, but particular attention should be given to the training of the interviewers to improve stability of the estimates.},

In order to depict the epidemiological framework of such injuries, data are mostly available for hospitalizations and partially for emergency room visits.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an estimate of the overall burden of such injuries in children in Italy. Our paper proposes the use of the scale up technique to overcome most of the pitfalls of classical techniques in the estimation of the number of children aged 0-14 that suffered a foreign body injury in 2004. Our results, based on a CATI survey on 1,081 women, show that the estimated number of children under 15 years that incurred in a foreign body injury was 15,829 (95\% CI: 14,376-17,282), of these 12,844 were treated in hospital or in emergency department (95\% CI: 11,535-14,153). The scale-up method in conjunction with a CATI survey provides a reliable estimate of the size of hard-to-count populations as those of injured children at lower costs with respect to classical sampling schemes.},

The scale-up estimator is robust and precise and the selection of subpopulations of known size is improved by our algorithm.},

With regard to research directed instead at estimating causal effects, we discuss three distinct weighting motives: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity; (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling; and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we find that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does.},

Four populations were simulated using different random graph models. Each population was ``infected'' using four different transmission processes. From each combination of population x transmission, one thousand samples were obtained using a RDS-like sampling strategy. Three estimators were used to predict the population-level prevalence of the ``infection''. Several types of misreported degrees were simulated. Also, samples were generated using the standard random sampling method and the respective prevalence estimates, using the classical frequentist estimator. Estimation biases in relation to population parameters were assessed, as well as the variance. Variability was associated with the connectivity characteristics of each simulated population. Clustered populations yield greater variability and no RDS-based strategy could address the estimation biases. Misreporting degrees had modest effects, especially when RDS estimators were used. The best results for RDS-based samples were observed when the ``infection'' was randomly attributed, without any relation with the underlying network structure.},

These links can be used to increase the sampling intensity of a hidden domain by tracing links from individuals selected in an initial wave of sampling to additional domain members. Chow and Thompson (2003,{\enspace}Survey Methodology{\enspace}29, 197--205) derived a Bayesian model to estimate the size or proportion of individuals in the hidden population for certain link-tracing designs. We propose an addition to their model that will allow for the modeling of a quantitative response. We assess properties of our model using a constructed population and a real population of at-risk individuals, both of which contain two domains of hidden and nonhidden individuals. Our results show that our model can produce good point and interval estimates of the population mean and domain means when our population assumptions are satisfied.},

In particular, the IMAGO collection, which contains Italian photos shot in the 20th century, was considered. Thanks to the IMAGO dataset, it was possible to apply different deep learning-based architectures to date images belonging to photo albums without needing any other sources of information. In addition, we carried out cross-dataset experiments, which also involved models trained on American datasets, observing temporal shifts which may be due to known intercultural influences. We further explore such a possibility by qualitatively analyzing the cross-dataset interpretation of the trained deep-learning models with the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm. In conclusion, deep learning models revealed their potential in terms of possible applications to intercultural research, from different points of view.},

Exploiting the proposed application, IMAGO has offered the opportunity of experimenting with photos taken between the years 1845 and 2009.

  abstract = {Background Gender-based violence is viewed as a significant problem in conflict-affected regions throughout the world. However, humanitarian organizations typically have been unable to reliably estimate the incidence of rape, intimate partner violence and other forms of sexual abuse in such settings. Such estimates are required to inform programming in contexts such as northern Uganda.Methods We sought to establish incidence rates for gender-based violence in internally-displaced-persons camps in northern Uganda. The assessments involved a ``neighbourhood methodology,'' in which adult female heads of household reported about their own, their sisters' and their neighbours' experiences. 299 households were selected for interview across four camps by using systematic random sampling.Findings Interviews were completed by 204 respondents (5 women having declined interview and 90 not having been successfully contacted). These respondents reported on themselves, a total of 268 sisters and 1206 neighbours. Reports with respect to these alternative populations produced estimates of overall incidence of intimate partner violence in the past year of 51.7\% (95\% CI 44.8 to 58.7; respondents), 44.0\% (95\% CI 41.2 to 46.9; respondents' sisters) and 36.5\% (95\% CI 30.7 to 42.3; respondents' neighbours). In the same period, estimates of incidence of forced sex by husbands were 41.0\% (95\% CI 34.2\% to 47.8\%), 22.1\% (95\% CI 17.0 to 27.2) and 25.1\% (95\% CI 22.5 to 27.6), respectively, with incidence of rape by a perpetrator other than an intimate partner estimated at 5.0\% (95\% CI 2.0\% to 8.0\%), 4.2\% (95\% CI 1.8 to 6.6) and 4.3\% (95\% CI 3.1 to 5.5), respectively.Interpretation Gender-based violence---particularly intimate partner violence---is commonplace in postconflict Uganda. The neighbourhood method provides a promising approach to estimating human right violations in humanitarian settings.},

  abstract = {Objective: This paper examines how mortality covaries with observed skin tone among blacks and in relation to whites. Additionally, the study analyzes the extent to which social factors such as socioeconomic status affect this relationship. Design: This study uses data from the 1982 General Social Survey (N = 1,689) data linked to the National Death Index until 2008. We use this data to examine the links between race, observed skin tone among blacks, and all-cause mortality. Piecewise exponential hazard modeling was used to estimate disparities in skin tone mortality among blacks, and relative to whites. The multivariate models control for age, education, gender, region, metropolitan statistical area, marital status, labor force status, and household income. Results: Observed skin tone is a significant determinant of mortality among blacks and in relation to whites. Light skinned blacks had the lowest mortality hazards among blacks, while respondents with medium and dark brown skin experienced significantly higher mortality. The observed skin tone mortality disparities covaried with education; there are significant mortality disparities across observed skin tone groups among black respondents with high school or more education, and nonsignificant disparities among those with less education. Conclusion: It is crucial to identify the social processes driving racial disparities in health and mortality. The findings reveal that the nuanced social experiences of blacks with different observed skin tones markedly change the experience of racial inequality. Research on the nuanced social processes and biological mechanisms that connect differences in observed skin tone to mortality outcomes promises to better illuminate the experience of racial inequality and policy mechanisms we can use to undermine it.},

  abstract = {Nature's ``responsible'' response to disease                            With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been global calls for the implementation of ``social distancing'' to control transmission. Throughout the world, some have resisted this requirement with the unfounded argument that it is unnecessary or ineffective. Social distancing, however, is a natural consequence of disease across animals, both human and nonhuman. Stockmaier               et al.               reviewed responses to disease across animal taxa and reveal how these responses naturally limit disease transmission. Understanding such natural responses and their impacts on pathogenic transmission provides epidemiological insight into our own responses to pandemic challenges.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eabc8881                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Contagious pathogens can trigger diverse changes in host social behaviors, rewiring their social networks and profoundly influencing the extent and pace of pathogen spread. Although ``social distancing'' is now an all too familiar strategy to manage COVID-19, nonhuman animals also exhibit a suite of pathogen-induced changes in social interactions, either as precautionary measures by healthy hosts or as physiological consequences of infection in sick individuals. These diverse changes in the social behaviors of both healthy and infected hosts in response to pathogens are widespread across taxa, but we still have much to learn about their underlying mechanisms and epidemiological and evolutionary consequences. Studies of social distancing behaviors in nonhuman animals have the potential to provide important and unique insights into ecological and evolutionary processes relevant to human public health, including pathogen transmission dynamics and virulence evolution.                                         ADVANCES               We synthesize the literature on pathogen-induced changes in sociality in nonhuman animals and in humans. These include active and passive changes in pathogen-exposed and -unexposed group members occurring both before and after individuals develop an active infection. Behavioral changes that reduce social interactions---and thus pathogen spread---include changes driven by infectious hosts, such as sickness behaviors and active self-isolation, as well as changes driven by healthy hosts, including active avoidance or exclusion of infectious individuals and proactive social distancing in the face of pathogenic threats. Although species have evolved behavioral social distancing because it reduces infection risk, these behaviors also incur costs by limiting access to the many benefits of group living, such as protection against predators and cooperative food finding. Thus, many species appear to have evolved the ability to alter the expression of these behaviors in ways that maximize benefits and minimize costs. The most susceptible individuals of some species show the strongest avoidance of sick conspecifics, and social distancing behaviors are sometimes foregone in interactions with close relatives. Pathogen-induced changes in sociality also apply important selection pressures on pathogens. Because social distancing reduces transmission and thus fitness, pathogens may evolve lower levels of virulence, presymptomatic transmission, or the ability to disguise cues that enable hosts to recognize their presence. Finally, pathogen infection can also increase social interactions when healthy individuals lend aid to pathogen-contaminated or sick conspecifics. Helping sick individuals is a major part of human and eusocial insect societies but is less commonly observed in other, nonhuman animals. Whether pathogens can evolve to elicit helping behavior in hosts, thus augmenting their own transmission, remains unknown.                                         OUTLOOK               The structure and dynamics of social contact networks fundamentally determine the fate of disease outbreaks, that is, how fast and far they spread and who will be infected. In the race to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous studies have begun to address the public health utility of unprecedented social distancing efforts. Nonhuman animal systems, particularly those with social structures similar to those of humans, present unique opportunities to inform relevant public health questions such as the effectiveness, variability, and required duration of social distancing measures. Further, the experimental tractability of nonhuman animal systems allows study of the coevolutionary dynamics generated by social distancing behaviors, which themselves have public health implications. Selection for or against social distancing behaviors has the potential to create a conflict of interest and could incentivize selfish behaviors that are not in the best interest of everyone.                                                   Social distancing in humans and nonhuman animals.                                        (                     A                     ) Pathogen-exposed forager ants self-isolate and their nestmates increase social distance to each other (image: Timoth{\'e}e Br{\"u}tsch). (                     B                     ) People social distance during COVID-19 (image: Forest Simon).

(                     D                     and                     E                     ) Under certain conditions, Trinidadian guppies avoid parasitized individuals (D), (image: Sean Earnshaw, University of St. Andrews) and house finches avoid sick conspecifics (E) (image: Jeremy Stanley).                                                                                            ,              Spread of contagious pathogens critically depends on the number and types of contacts between infectious and susceptible hosts. Changes in social behavior by susceptible, exposed, or sick individuals thus have far-reaching downstream consequences for infectious disease spread. Although ``social distancing'' is now an all too familiar strategy for managing COVID-19, nonhuman animals also exhibit pathogen-induced changes in social interactions. Here, we synthesize the effects of infectious pathogens on social interactions in animals (including humans), review what is known about underlying mechanisms, and consider implications for evolution and epidemiology.},

Methods: The UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Models and Projections recommends updates to the methodology and assumptions based on the latest research findings and international policy and programme guidelines. The latest update to Spectrum has been used in the 2005 round of global estimates. Results: Several new features have been added to Spectrum in the past two years. New patterns of the age distribution of prevalence over time are based on the latest survey data. A more detailed treatment of mother to child transmission of HIV is now based on information about current breastfeeding practices, treatment options offered to prevent mother to child transmission (PMTCT), infant feeding options, and the percentage or number of pregnant women accessing PMTCT services. A new section on child survival includes the effects of cotrimoxazole and ART on child survival. Projections can now be calibrated with national survey data. A new set of outputs is provided for all adults over the age of 15 in addition to the traditional 15--49 age group. New outputs are now available to show plausibility bounds and regional estimates for key indicators. Conclusions: The latest update to the Spectrum program is intended to incorporate the latest research findings and provide new outputs needed by national and international planners.},

  abstract = {Summary Background In 2011, WHO member states signed up to the 25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}25 initiative, a plan to cut mortality due to non-communicable diseases by 25\% by 2025. However, socioeconomic factors influencing non-communicable diseases have not been included in the plan. In this study, we aimed to compare the contribution of socioeconomic status to mortality and years-of-life-lost with that of the 25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}25 conventional risk factors. Methods We did a multicohort study and meta-analysis with individual-level data from 48 independent prospective cohort studies with information about socioeconomic status, indexed by occupational position, 25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}25 risk factors (high alcohol intake, physical inactivity, current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), and mortality, for a total population of 1\hphantom{,}751\hphantom{,}479 (54\% women) from seven high-income WHO member countries. We estimated the association of socioeconomic status and the 25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}25 risk factors with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality by calculating minimally adjusted and mutually adjusted hazard ratios [HR] and 95\% CIs. We also estimated the population attributable fraction and the years of life lost due to suboptimal risk factors. Findings During 26{$\cdot$}6 million person-years at risk (mean follow-up 13{$\cdot$}3 years [SD 6{$\cdot$}4 years]), 310\hphantom{,}277 participants died. HR for the 25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}25 risk factors and mortality varied between 1{$\cdot$}04 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}98--1{$\cdot$}11) for obesity in men and 2\hphantom{,}{$\cdot$}17 (2{$\cdot$}06--2{$\cdot$}29) for current smoking in men. Participants with low socioeconomic status had greater mortality compared with those with high socioeconomic status (HR 1{$\cdot$}42, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}38--1{$\cdot$}45 for men; 1{$\cdot$}34, 1{$\cdot$}28--1{$\cdot$}39 for women); this association remained significant in mutually adjusted models that included the 25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}25 factors (HR 1{$\cdot$}26, 1{$\cdot$}21--1{$\cdot$}32, men and women combined). The population attributable fraction was highest for smoking, followed by physical inactivity then socioeconomic status. Low socioeconomic status was associated with a 2{$\cdot$}1-year reduction in life expectancy between ages 40 and 85 years, the corresponding years-of-life-lost were 0{$\cdot$}5 years for high alcohol intake, 0{$\cdot$}7 years for obesity, 3{$\cdot$}9 years for diabetes, 1{$\cdot$}6 years for hypertension, 2{$\cdot$}4 years for physical inactivity, and 4{$\cdot$}8 years for current smoking. Interpretation Socioeconomic circumstances, in addition to the 25\hphantom{,}{\texttimes}\hphantom{,}25 factors, should be targeted by local and global health strategies and health risk surveillance to reduce mortality.

  abstract = {Over the last 200 years, humans experienced a huge increase of life expectancy. These advances were largely driven by extrinsic improvements of their environment (for example, the available diet, disease prevalence, vaccination, and the state of hygiene and sanitation). In this paper, we ask whether future improvements of life expectancy will be bounded from above by human life span. Life span, in contrast to life expectancy, is conceptualized as a biological measure of longevity driven by the intrinsic rate of bodily deterioration. In order to pursue our question, we first present a modern theory of aging developed by bio-gerontologists and show that immutable life span would put an upper limit on life expectancy. We then show for a sample of developed countries that human life span thus defined was indeed constant until the mid-twentieth century but increased since then in sync with life expectancy. In other words, we find evidence for manufactured life span.},

The network sampling approach was a more economical and methodologically less obtrusive means of increasing sample size of persons with desired characteristics than conventional procedures. The approach requires estimating the incidence, prevalence, or both of the required characteristics in the population. As the proportion of persons in the population with the characteristic increases, network sampling may lose its attractiveness. However, this has to be judged both in economic terms and in terms of the methodologic consequences of using other procedures to increase the size of subgroups of interest. As discussed, additional methodologic work is required on the consequences of network sampling for study group representativeness and sampling bias. However, network sampling, in the authors' opinion, is sufficiently promising to warrant methodologic explorations to answer these and other relevant questions about its use.}

  abstract = {Introduction An accurate estimation of the population size of men who have sex with men (MSM) is critical to the success of HIV program planning and to monitoring of the response to epidemic as a whole, but is quite often missing. In this study, our aim was to estimate the population size of MSM in Tbilisi, Georgia and compare it with other estimates in the region. Methods In the absence of a gold standard for estimating the population size of MSM, this study reports a range of methods, including network scale-up, mobile/web apps multiplier, service and unique object multiplier, network-based capture-recapture, Handcock RDS-based and Wisdom of Crowds methods. To apply all these methods, two surveys were conducted: first, a household survey among 1,015 adults from the general population, and second, a respondent driven sample of 210 MSM. We also conducted a literature review of MSM size estimation in Eastern European and Central Asian countries. Results The median population size of MSM generated from all previously mentioned methods was estimated to be 5,100 (95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 3,243 {\textasciitilde} 9,088). This corresponds to 1.42\% (95\%CI: 0.9\% {\textasciitilde} 2.53\%) of the adult male population in Tbilisi. Conclusion Our size estimates of the MSM population (1.42\% (95\%CI: 0.9\% {\textasciitilde} 2.53\%) of the adult male population in Tbilisi) fall within ranges reported in other Eastern European and Central Asian countries. These estimates can provide valuable information for country level HIV prevention program planning and evaluation. Furthermore, we believe, that our results will narrow the gap in data availability on the estimates of the population size of MSM in the region.},

  abstract = {Background Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems play a key role in upholding human rights and generating data for health and good governance. They also can help monitor progress in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Although many countries have made substantial progress in strengthening their CRVS systems, most low- and middle-income countries still have underdeveloped systems. The objective of this systematic review is to identify national policies that can help countries strengthen their systems. Methods and findings The ABI/INFORM, Embase, JSTOR, PubMed, and WHO Index Medicus databases were systematically searched for policies to improve birth and/or death registration on 24 January 2017. Global stakeholders were also contacted for relevant grey literature. For the purposes of this review, policies were categorised as supply, demand, incentive, penalty, or combination (i.e., at least two of the preceding policy approaches). Quantitative results on changes in vital event registration rates were presented for individual comparative articles. Qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, was used for qualitative syntheses on operational considerations encompassing acceptability to recipients and staff, human resource requirements, information technology or infrastructure requirements, costs to the health system, unintended effects, facilitators, and barriers. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018085768. Thirty-five articles documenting experience in implementing policies to improve birth and/or death registration were identified. Although 25 countries representing all global regions (Africa, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean) were reflected, there were limited countries from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Twenty-four articles reported policy effects on birth and/or death registration. Twenty-one of the 24 articles found that the change in registration rate after the policy was positive, with two supply and one penalty articles being the exceptions. The qualitative syntheses identified 15 operational considerations across all policy categories. Human and financial resource requirements were not quantified. The primary limitation of this systematic review was the threat of publication bias wherein many countries may not have documented their experience; this threat is most concerning for policies that had neutral or negative effects. Conclusions Our systematic review suggests that combination policy approaches, consisting of at least a supply and demand component, were consistently associated with improved registration rates in different geographical contexts. Operational considerations should be interpreted based on health system, governance, and sociocultural context. More evaluations and research are needed from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Further research and evaluation are also needed to estimate the human and financial resource requirements required for different policies.},

A `social support' perspective argues that informal networks are central to objective and subjective welfare; an `inequality' thesis posits that widening economic disparities have eroded citizens' sense of social justice and inclusion, which in turn has led to heightened anxiety and compromised rising life expectancies; a `political economy' approach sees the primary determinant of poor health outcomes as the socially and politically mediated exclusion from material resources. A more comprehensive but grounded theory of social capital is presented that develops a distinction between bonding, bridging, and linking social capital. It is argued that this framework helps to reconcile these three perspectives, incorporating a broader reading of history, politics, and the empirical evidence regarding the mechanisms connecting types of network structure and state---society relations to public health outcomes.}

Inspired by the original experiments of Milgram, we simulated message routing within a representative sub-graph of the network of Twitter users with about 6 million geo-located nodes and 122 million edges. We picked pairs of users from two distant metropolitan areas and tried to find a route between them using local geographic information only; our method was to forward messages to a friend living closest to the target. We found that the examined network is navigable on large scales, but navigability breaks down at the city scale and the network becomes unnavigable on intra-city distances. This means that messages usually arrived to the close proximity of the target in only 3--6 steps, but only in about 20\% of the cases was it possible to find a route all the way to the recipient, in spite of the network being connected. This phenomenon is supported by the distribution of link lengths; on larger scales the distribution behaves approximately as , which was found earlier by Kleinberg to allow efficient navigation, while on smaller scales, a fractal structure becomes apparent. The intra-city correlation dimension of the network was found to be , less than the dimension of the distribution of the population.},

METHODS Sampling was stratified by geographical region. A total of 6006 interviews were conducted. Indicators of knowledge and sexual practices and the relative sizes of the vulnerable subgroups were estimated. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the main factors associated with safe sex practices. RESULTS Regarding knowledge indicators in the age group 15-24 years, a high percentage (91\%) spontaneously cited sexual intercourse as a form of HIV transmission, and 62\% had correct knowledge of the modes of HIV transmission (five correct items). The proportion of consistent condom use with casual partners was 52\%, increasing to 59\% in the youngest age group. Higher proportions of inconsistent condom use with any kind of partner were found among women and among the poorest. A multiplicity of sexual partners, low socio-economic status and cocaine use were important predictors of unprotected sex among men living without a companion. Among individuals aged 15-49 years, 0.2\% currently inject cocaine, 4.6\% of the men paid for sex at least once over the past year and 1.0\% of the women were paid in exchange for sex. Among sexually active men of the same age group, 3.5\% reported sexual relations with other men. CONCLUSION Besides the need to establish the role exercised by the vulnerable subgroups in the HIV transmission dynamics, results indicate that it is necessary to investigate unsafe sexual practices further among the poorer sectors of society.},

Residential dissimilarity among whites, mulattoes (browns) and blacks is only moderate by U.S. standards. White-black dissimilarity is the highest, followed by brown-black and then white-brown dissimilarity. Residential segregation within income groups is lowest for the low income groups and increases with increasing income level. For most of the white middle class, residential separation is ensured by the concentration of blacks and mulattoes in low socioeconomic classes and in distinct regions. Multivariate analysis reveals that an urban area's socioeconomic status and housing market are strong predictors of overall residential segregation: segregation is significantly higher in urban areas with high occupational inequality, low mean income, high levels of housing turnover, and high homeownership. Measures of industrialization, immigrant influence and color heterogeneity were not significant. Implications for Brazilian race relations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Attrition is the Achilles heel of longitudinal surveys. Drawing on our experience in the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), we describe survey design and field strategies that contributed to minimizing attrition over four waves of the survey. The data are used to illustrate the selectivity of respondents who attrit from the survey and, also the selectivity of respondents who move from the place they were interviewed at baseline and are subsequently interviewed in a new location. The results provide insights into the nature of selection that will arise in studies that fail to track and interview movers. Attrition, and types of attrition, are related in complex ways to a broad array of characteristics measured at baseline. In addition, the evidence suggests attrition may be related to characteristics that are not observed in our baseline. Integrating IFLS with data from a Survey of Surveyors, we describe characteristics of both the interviewers and the interview that predict attrition in later waves. These characteristics point to possible strategies that may reduce levels of attrition and may also reduce the impact of attrition on the interpretation of behavioral models estimated with longitudinal data.},

In the most general case, the method consists of dividing the value of the variable of interest associated with each detected object by the detection probability for that object and then proceeding to use the estimation method that would ordinarily be used under the design if there were no detectability problems. Examples illustrating the method include simple random sampling, conventional unequal probability sampling, and adaptive cluster sampling.}

This Second Edition's extensive new material includes descriptions of new developments, a wider range of approaches to common problems, historical notes, and increased coverage of topics such as methods that combine design and model-based approaches, adjusting for nonsampling errors, and the use of link-tracing designs. Updated chapters show how relevant sampling methods function within such fields as the biological, environmental, and geological sciences; social and health sciences; and sampling the Internet.Organized into six sections, this edition covers basic sampling, from simple random to unequal probability sampling; the use of auxiliary data with ratio estimators and regression estimation; sufficient data, model, and design in practical sampling; useful designs such as stratified, cluster and systematic, multistage, double and network sampling; detectability methods for elusive populations; spatial sampling; and adaptive sampling designs. Additional derivations, notes on underlying ideas, exercises, and examples foster a greater mastery of the presented techniques. New numerical examples, small-population examples, and exercises have been added.Featuring a wider range of topics than other sampling books, Sampling, Second Edition is the ideal reference for scientific researchers and other professionals who use sampling, as well as students in sampling courses.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: These studies examined whether differences between self-reports and proxy reports of disabilities reflect proxy response biases or only respondent selection factors. METHODS: The data were from the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (1994-1995, phases 1 and 2). In study 1, reports of disabilities were regressed on respondent status, self vs proxy, and demographic factors. In study 2, the ratios of the proportions of self-reports and proxy reports of disabilities were regressed on independent lay ratings of observability of these disabilities and their "interactional" nature. In study 3, the disability reports for people who differed in respondent status in one phase but self-reported the same disability in the other phase were compared. RESULTS: In study 1, proxies under-reported disabilities for people aged 18 to 64 years but overreported for people 65 years or older. In study 2, the observability and interactional scores accounted for more than 60\% of the variance of self and proxy differences in an inverse relationship, study 3 confirmed the basic findings of study 1. CONCLUSIONS: Use of proxies in representative surveys on disability introduces systematic biases, affecting national disability estimates.},

Using repeated cross-sectional surveys between the early 1970s and the late 1990s and a counterfactual approach, we disentangle cohort from period interpretations of change, and examine the mechanisms driving change in fluidity among Brazilian men. We detect a substantial increase in social fluidity over time, which emerges from period transformation, rather than cohort replacement. This trend departs from industrialized nations, where growing fluidity has been found to be entirely driven by the replacement of older, more rigid cohorts by younger, more fluid ones, and to emerge from educational equalization and a "compositional effect"--educational expansion combined with a weaker intergenerational association among those with higher education. In contrast, in a context of rapid late industrialization, two mechanisms account for growing fluidity in Brazil: the decline in the "economic returns to schooling", and the weakening of the direct influence of class origins on class destination, net of education. We discuss the implications of these patterns for the understanding of mobility dynamics in different national contexts.},

Interviews were conducted with an area probability sample of more than 300 adults in Cook County, Illinois. The experiment also compared open and closed questions about the number of sex partners and varied the context in which the sex partner itemswere embeded. The three mode groups did not differ in response rates, but the mode of data collection did affect the level of reporting of sensitive behaviors: both forms of self-administration tended to reduce the disparity between men and women in the number of sex partners reported. Self-administration, especially via ACASI, also increased the proportion of respondents admitting that they had used illicit drugs. In addition, when the closed answer options emphasized the low end of the distribution, fewer sex partners were reported than when the options emphasized the high end of the distribution; responses to the open-ended versions of the sex partner items generally fell between responses to the two closed versions.},

Victims, out of feelings of shame or fear, underreport this form of violence. We tackle this problem by administering a list experiment in a representative survey in Sri Lanka, which is only recently recovering from an ethnic civil war between Sinhalese and Tamils. This unobtrusive method reveals that around 13 percent of the Sri Lankan population has personally experienced sexual assault during the war---a prevalence ten times higher than elicited by direct questioning. We also identify vulnerable groups: Tamils who have collaborated with rebel groups and the male-displaced population suspected of collaboration with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Our experimental evidence thus lends support to reports on the asymmetric use of sexual violence by government forces, qualifies conventional wisdom on sexual violence during war, and has important implications for policy.},

  abstract = {The item count technique is an indirect questioning technique that is used to estimate the proportion of people who have engaged in stigmatizing behavior. This technique is expected to yield a more appropriate estimate than the ordinary direct questioning technique because it requests respondents to indicate, based on a list of several items, simply the number of items that are applicable to them, including the target key item. An experimental web survey was conducted in an attempt to compare the direct questioning technique and the item count technique. Compared with the direct questioning technique, the item count technique yielded higher estimates of the proportion of shoplifters by nearly 10 percentage points, whereas the difference between the estimates using these two techniques was mostly insignificant with respect to innocuous blood donation. The survey results suggest that in the item count technique respondents tend to report fewer total behaviors compared to the direct question case. This tendency is more pronounced in the case of longer item lists. Three domain estimators for the item count technique were compared, and the cross-based method appeared to be the most appropriate method. Large differences in domain estimates for shoplifting between the item count and direct questioning techniques were found among female respondents, middle-aged respondents, respondents living in urban areas, and highly-educated respondents.}

Focusing on these two striking and critical population trends, the report considers replacement migration for eight low-fertility countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States) and two regions (Europe and the European Union).

  abstract = {Survey sampling is fundamentally an applied field. The goal in this book is to put an array of tools at the fingertips of practitioners by explaining approaches long used by survey statisticians, illustrating how existing software can be used to solve survey problems, and developing some specialized software where needed. This book serves at least three audiences: (1) Students seeking a more in-depth understanding of applied sampling either through a second semester-long course or by way of a supplementary reference; (2) Survey statisticians searching for practical guidance on how to apply concepts learned in theoretical or applied sampling courses; and (3) Social scientists and other survey practitioners who desire insight into the statistical thinking and steps taken to design, select, and weight random survey samples. Several survey data sets are used to illustrate how to design samples, to make estimates from complex surveys for use in optimizing the sample allocation, and to calculate weights. Realistic survey projects are used to demonstrate the challenges and provide a context for the solutions. The book covers several topics that either are not included or are dealt with in a limited way in other texts. These areas include: sample size computations for multistage designs; power calculations related to surveys; mathematical programming for sample allocation in a multi-criteria optimization setting; nuts and bolts of area probability sampling; multiphase designs; quality control of survey operations; and statistical software for survey sampling and estimation. An associated R package, PracTools, contains a number of specialized functions for sample size and other calculations. The data sets used in the book are also available in PracTools, so that the reader may replicate the examples or perform further analyses. The book contains a Preface, Acknowledgements and 18 chapters divided over four parts. Chapter 1: An Overview of Sample Design and Weighting, is followed by Part 1: "Designing Single-Stage Sample Surveys" with Chapter 2: Project 1: Design a Single-Stage Personnel Survey; Chapter 3: Sample Design and Sample Size for Single-Stage Surveys; Chapter 4: Power Calculations and Sample Size Determination; Chapter 5: Mathematical Programming; Chapter 6: Outcome Rates and Effect on Sample Size; and Chapter 7: The Personnel Survey Design Project: One Solution. Part II: "Multistage Designs" includes Chapter 8: Project 2: Designing an Area Sample; Chapter 9: Designing Multistage Samples; Chapter 10: Area Sampling; and Chapter 11: The Area Sample Design: One Solution. Part III:" Survey Weights and Analyses" follows with Chapter 12: Project 3: Weighting a Personnel Survey; Chapter 13: Basic Steps in Weighting; Chapter 14: Calibration and Other Uses of Auxiliary Data; Chapter 15: Variance Estimation, and Chapter 16: Weighting the Personnel Survey: One Solution. Part IV: "Other Topics" follows with Chapter 17: Multiphase Designs; and Chapter 18: Process Control and Quality Measures. Appended are: (1) Notation Glossary; (2) Data Sets; and (3) R Functions Used in this Book. Also included are References, Solutions to Selected Exercises, an Author Index, and a Subject Index.},

Justice is done to the hierarchical nested structure of the data and the resulting dependence between observations '' within egos''. Multilevel techniques can also give more specific insight on why personal networks change: they allow to distinguish between the influence of individual and of tie characteristics on the stability of personal networks as a whole and of specific ties within a personal network.

  abstract = {Collecting survey data on ego-centered social networks is a difficult task, owing to the complex questionnaire format. Usually, the interviewer handles the dynamics of the question--answer exchange, motivates the respondent and ensures the proper recording of the data. Self-administered modes of data collection, especially web data collection, are more problematic, as the respondents are left alone with a complex and burdensome questionnaire. Therefore, questionnaire layout is crucial for ensuring cooperation and data quality. In this paper we examined three key components of the corresponding web questionnaire: the number of name boxes using a single name generator, question format for assessing alter characteristics (i.e. alter-wise vs. question-wise) and number of name interpreters (i.e. alter characteristics). The number of name boxes was found to be essential for the reported size of social networks and also for some aspects of data quality. Specific data quality effects were also found with respect to variations in question format, where question-wise format performed better than alter-wise. The number of name interpreters had a relatively minor effect. Suggestions for possible standardization of the web interface layout are also given, so that equivalence with other data collection modes can be established.},

  abstract = {This paper explores bias in the estimation of sampling variance in Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS). Prior work has demonstrated that RDS has the potential to exhibit high sampling variance in certain networks (Goel and Salganik 2010, Lu et al. 2011). However, because the sampling variance of RDS depends on the network structure of the population, it is unclear to what degree the results from specific networks apply to networks in general. In this paper, we show that RDS sampling variance relies on a critical assumption that the network is First Order Markov (FOM) with respect to the dependent variable of interest. We demonstrate, through intuitive examples, mathematical generalizations, and computational experiments that the sampling variance of RDS will always be underestimated in empirical networks that do not conform to the FOM assumption. Analysis of 215 observed university and school networks from Facebook and Add Health indicates that the FOM assumption is frequently violated in empirical networks (in over 90\% of the networks we analyze) and that violating the FOM assumption leads to large biases in RDS estimates of sampling variance. We propose and test two alternative variance estimation strategies that show some promise for reducing biases, but which also illustrate the limits of estimating sampling variance with only partial information on the underlying population network.},

Following the Cochrane collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA statement, our systematic search and selection yielded 178 papers covering the period 2010--2015. We observe an increasing trend in published BCMs, frequently coupled to (re)emergence events, and propose a categorization by distinguishing how information translates into preventive actions. Behaviour is usually captured by introducing information as a dynamic parameter (76/178) or by introducing an economic objective function, either with (26/178) or without (37/178) imitation. Approaches using information thresholds (29/178) and exogenous behaviour formation (16/178) are also popular. We further classify according to disease, prevention measure, transmission model (with 81/178 population, 6/178 metapopulation and 91/178 individual-level models) and the way prevention impacts transmission. We highlight the minority (15\%) of studies that use any real-life data for parametrization or validation and note that BCMs increasingly use social media data and generally incorporate multiple sources of information (16/178), multiple types of information (17/178) or both (9/178). We conclude that individual-level models are increasingly used and useful to model behaviour changes. Despite recent advancements, we remain concerned that most models are purely theoretical and lack representative data and a validation process.},

However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15----where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., ``echo chambers.'' Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades' size.},

Mortality and first incidence of ischemic heart disease, cancer, stroke, and hypertension were assessed over the next 15 years. Outcome data were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, SES, and baseline health status. Persons with histories of a given morbidity at or prior to baseline were excluded from the analyses of that morbidity. Social network measures, particularly network scope (a measure of the number of different domains in which a person has social contacts), were powerful predictors of 15-year mortality hazard, but weak predictors of incident disease. Only network scope predicted IHD incidence, and none of the other morbidities was predicted by the social network measures. However, social network measures were strong predictors of both cause-specific and all-cause mortality among persons who had incident cases of IHD, cancer, and stroke.

  abstract = {The emergence and global impact of the novel influenza A(H1N1)v highlights the continuous threat to public health posed by a steady stream of new and unexpected infectious disease outbreaks in animals and humans. Once an emerging epidemic is detected, public health authorities will attempt to mitigate the epidemic by, among other measures, reducing further spread as much as possible. Scarce and/or costly control measures such as vaccines, anti-infective drugs, and social distancing must be allocated while epidemiological characteristics of the disease remain uncertain. Here we present first principles for allocating scarce resources with limited data. We show that under a broad class of assumptions, the simple rule of targeting intervention measures at the group with the highest risk of infection per individual will achieve the largest reduction in the transmission potential of a novel infection. For vaccination of susceptible persons, the appropriate risk measure is force of infection; for social distancing, the appropriate risk measure is incidence of infection. Unlike existing methods that rely on detailed knowledge of group-specific transmission rates, the method described here can be implemented using only data that are readily available during an epidemic, and allows ready adaptation as the epidemic progresses. The need to observe risk of infection helps to focus the ongoing planning and design of new infectious disease surveillance programs; from the presented first principles for allocating scarce resources, we can adjust the prioritization of groups for intervention when new observations on an emerging epidemic become available.},

  abstract = {How does social network structure amplify or stifle behavior diffusion? Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more---both farther and faster---on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5\% margin in only 22\% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions. This pattern reflects a fundamental trade-off: Random ties enhance reach, while clustered ties enhance social reinforcement.}

One of the problems we address is how to estimate a hazard function when only aggregated information on the lifetimes in the form of a lifetable is available. This problem affects the estimation of oldest-old mortality which in turn plays an important role in the quantification of biological lifespan and longevity. We illustrate these issues with an analysis of mortality data obtained from cohorts of nematodes. The methods involve data transformation with the aim of bias reduction when estimating the hazard function. We provide rigorous asymptotic results for the smoothing of lifetables and show that the transformation approach is supported by both asymptotic and simulation results. We also demonstrate how the information contained in many samples of lifetables, as typically obtained in aging experiments, can be summarized in a two-dimensional hazard surface.}

However, size estimation of MSM populations is still a significant public health challenge due to high cost, hard to reach and stigma associated with the population. Objectives We aimed to estimate the social network size (c value) in general population and the size of MSM population in Shanghai, China by using the net work scale-up method. Methods A multistage random sampling was used to recruit participants aged from 18 to 60 years who had lived in Shanghai for at least 6 months. The ``known population method'' with adjustment of backward estimation and regression model was applied to estimate the c value. And the MSM population size was further estimated using an adjusted c value taking into account for the transmission effect through social respect level towards MSM. Results A total of 4017 participants were contacted for an interview, and 3907 participants met the inclusion criterion. The social network size (c value) of participants was 236 after adjustment. The estimated size of MSM was 36354 (95\% CI: 28489--44219) for the male Shanghaies aged 18 to 60 years, and the proportion of MSM among the total male population aged 18 to 60 years in Shanghai was 0.28\%. Conclusions We employed the network scale-up method and used a wide range of data sources to estimate the size of MSM population in Shanghai, which is useful for HIV prevention and intervention among the target population.},

  abstract = {Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked who they intend to vote for. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

  abstract = {Summary  Background  Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures.  Methods  We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14294 geography--year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).  Findings  Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61{$\cdot$}7 years (95\% uncertainty interval 61{$\cdot$}4--61{$\cdot$}9) in 1980 to 71{$\cdot$}8 years (71{$\cdot$}5--72{$\cdot$}2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11{$\cdot$}3 years (3{$\cdot$}7--17{$\cdot$}4), to 62{$\cdot$}6 years (56{$\cdot$}5--70{$\cdot$}2). Total deaths increased by 4{$\cdot$}1\% (2{$\cdot$}6--5{$\cdot$}6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55{$\cdot$}8 million (54{$\cdot$}9 million to 56{$\cdot$}6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17{$\cdot$}0\% (15{$\cdot$}8--18{$\cdot$}1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14{$\cdot$}1\% (12{$\cdot$}6--16{$\cdot$}0) to 39{$\cdot$}8 million (39{$\cdot$}2 million to 40{$\cdot$}5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13{$\cdot$}1\% (11{$\cdot$}9--14{$\cdot$}3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42{$\cdot$}1\%, 39{$\cdot$}1--44{$\cdot$}6), malaria (43{$\cdot$}1\%, 34{$\cdot$}7--51{$\cdot$}8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29{$\cdot$}8\%, 24{$\cdot$}8--34{$\cdot$}9), and maternal disorders (29{$\cdot$}1\%, 19{$\cdot$}3--37{$\cdot$}1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146000 deaths, 118000--183000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393000 deaths, 228000--532000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death.  Interpretation  At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

Here we show that human children as young as 18 months of age (prelinguistic or just-linguistic) quite readily help others to achieve their goals in a variety of different situations. This requires both an understanding of others' goals and an altruistic motivation to help. In addition, we demonstrate similar though less robust skills and motivations in three young chimpanzees.},

The risk groups studied were injecting drug users and their sexual partners. Due to the clandestine nature of illicit drug use, we were faced with two interrelated problems: developing a scientific method to monitor the spread of the HIV infection among these drug users and their sexual partners, groups generally thought to be especially difficult to reach; and creating a health education intervention that would help stop the epidemic from spreading among this population and through them to other members of the community. The method we developed to sample injecting drug users is called targeted sampling. Although it incorporates some aspects of other well established sampling strategies, it is sufficiently different to be treated as a separate research method. Further, targeted sampling provides a cohesive set of research methods that can help researchers study health or social problems that exist among populations that are difficult to reach because of their attributed social stigma, legal status, and consequent lack of visibility.},

This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades---herein called global cascades---that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.}

There are many potential perpetrators, including spouses and partners, parents, other family members, neighbours, and men in positions of power or influence. Most forms of violence are not unique incidents but are ongoing, and can even continue for decades. Because of the sensitivity of the subject, violence is almost universally under-reported. Nevertheless, the prevalence of such violence suggests that globally, millions of women are experiencing violence or living with its consequences.}

Utilizing the Matlab Health and Socioeconomic Surveys, we examined the roles of migration and families in four domains of empowerment for women in Bangladesh. We found that women with international migrant spouses saw significant improvements in economic empowerment, mobility, and decision-making relative to women with coresident spouses (p\,\&lt;\,.0001). However, women who lived in multigenerational households with their parents or in-laws experienced significant reductions in empowerment across these three domains. Both having a migrant spouse and living in a multigenerational household had negative effects on beliefs about gender equivalence and reduced joint decision-making for women. Results, which were robust to migration selection controls (including propensity approaches), indicate that the benefits of migration for women left behind might be diluted by family structures that perpetuate unequal gender dynamics.}

How stable are these networks over time? And if one participant in a conversation reports it, does the other? The data come from a longitudinal survey of ego-centered conversational networks and reproductive behavior in small villages in rural Kenya. Because network partners were also interviewed in one of the four research sites, we are able to compare the respondents' reports of their alters' behavior with these alters' self reports. We find a strong relationship between the reported behavior of egos and their reports of their alters' behavior, as others have done elsewhere. However, discrepancies between the respondents' reports of their network partners contraceptive behavior and their network partners' self reports are substantial. Levels of network stability and reciprocity were also low. The discrepancies between the respondents' reports of their network partners and the partners' own reports are primarily due to incorrect reporting by the respondents, whereas the low levels of stability and reciprocity are related to the difficulties of measuring regular but diffuse social structures. Some of our results are specific to the context of rural Kenya, but other are more likely to be generalizable. The influence of social networks on behavior may be strong or weak, but its measurement has systematic problems.},

  abstract = {Although there is no doubt that significant morbidity and mortality occur during annual influenza epidemics, the role of contextual circumstances, which catalyze seasonal influenza transmission, remains unclear. Weather conditions are believed to affect virus survival, efficiency of transmission and host immunity, but seasonality may also be driven by a tendency of people to congregate indoors during periods of bad weather. To test this hypothesis, we combined data from a social contact survey in Belgium with local weather data. In the absence of a previous in-depth weather impact analysis of social contact patterns, we explored the possibilities and identified pitfalls. We found general dominance of day-type (weekend, holiday, working day) over weather conditions, but nonetheless observed an increase in long duration contacts (1 hour) on regular workdays with low temperatures, almost no precipitation and low absolute humidity of the air. Interestingly, these conditions are often assumed to be beneficial for virus survival and transmission. Further research is needed to establish the impact of the weather on social contacts. We recommend that future studies sample over a broad spectrum of weather conditions and day types and include a sufficiently large proportion of holiday periods and weekends.},

We analyzed this social contact data in terms of weighted social contact matrices, next generation matrices, relative incidence and R0. We incorporated location-specific isolation measures (e.g. school closure or telework) and capture their effect on transmission dynamics. All methods have been implemented in an online application based on R Shiny and applied to COVID-19 with age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness. Using our online tool with the available social contact data, we illustrate that social distancing could have a considerable impact on reducing transmission for COVID-19. The effect itself depends on assumptions made about disease-specific characteristics and the choice of intervention(s).

Although descriptions of such studies have proliferated in both the published and unpublished literatures, there has been little effort to reconcile discrepant views, approaches, and findings. The current synthesis reviews 32 CCCI studies located in peer-reviewed journals and books, along with key unpublished sources, to characterize these investigations in terms of their purpose, procedures, and findings. Based on a number of trends in this emergent field, conclusions are made concerning appropriate methods for cognitive testing of cross-cultural instruments, and recommendations are made for future practices that will serve to advance the CCCI field.}

To inform this debate, a wide array of indicators have been developed to assess the joint influence of fertility, mortality, and migration on birth replacement and intergenerational replacement. These indicators are based on various models and assumptions and some are particularly data demanding. In this article we propose a simple method to assess how far migration alters the extent of replacement for a birth cohort as it ages. We term the measure the overall replacement ratio (ORR). It is calculated by taking the size of a female birth cohort at selected ages divided by the average size of the cohorts of mothers in the year of birth. We present estimates of the ORR for a range of European countries representing different replacement regimes. We demonstrate that for many countries net migration has become a key factor in their population trends during the last few decades.},

Based on individual validation data, we focus on two questions: First, does the RRT lead to higher prevalence estimates of sensitive behavior than direct questioning (DQ)? Second, are there differences in the effects of determinants of misreporting according to question mode? The data come from 552 face-to-face interviews with subjects who had been convicted by a court for minor criminal offences in a metropolitan area in Germany. For the first question, the answer is negative. For the second, it is positive, that is, effects of individual and situational determinants of misreporting differ between the two question modes. The effect of need for social approval, for example, tends to be stronger in RRT than in DQ mode. Interviewer experience turns out to be positively related to answer validity in DQ and negatively in RRT mode. Our findings support a skeptical position toward RRT, shed new light on long-standing debates within survey methodology, and stimulate theoretical reasoning about response behavior in surveys.},

  abstract = {Surveys often contain sensitive questions, that is, questions about private, illegal, or socially undesirable behavior. When asked directly in standard survey modes, respondents tend to underreport these behaviors, yielding biased results. One method that promises more valid estimates than direct questioning (DQ) is the item count technique (ICT). In this paper, methodological benefits and disadvantages of the ICT, as compared to DQ, are empirically evaluated with regard to questions on self-reported delinquency. We present findings from a face-to-face survey of 552 respondents who had been convicted under criminal law prior to the survey. The results show that, first, subjective measures of survey quality such as trust in anonymity or willingness to respond are not affected positively by the ICT with the exception that interviewers feel less uncomfortable asking sensitive questions in ICT mode than in DQ mode. Second, all prevalence estimates of self-reported delinquent behaviors are significantly higher in ICT than in DQ mode. Third, a regression model on determinants of response behavior indicates that the effect of the ICT on response validity varies by gender. All in all, our results are in favor of the ICT. This technique is a promising alternative to other special questioning techniques such as the much more complicated randomized response technique (RRT).},

Mortality deceleration---the slowing of mortality's rise with age---has been considered an important window into heterogeneity that otherwise might be impossible to explore. In this article, I argue that deceleration patterns may reveal surprisingly little about the heterogeneity that putatively produces them. I show that even in a very simple model---one that is composed of just two subpopulations with Gompertz mortality---(1) aggregate mortality can decelerate even while a majority of the cohort is frail; (2) multiple decelerations are possible; and (3) mortality selection can produce acceleration as well as deceleration. Simulations show that these patterns are plausible in model cohorts that in the aggregate resemble cohorts in the Human Mortality Database. I argue that these results challenge some conventional heuristics for understanding the relationship between selection and deceleration; undermine certain inferences from deceleration timing to patterns of social inequality; and imply that standard parametric models, assumed to plateau at most once, may sometimes badly misestimate deceleration timing---even by decades.},

Even though periods and cohorts are identical in a stationary population, we show that the answer to this question is not life expectancy but a length-biased version of life expectancy. That is, the distribution of lifespans of the people alive at a single moment is a self-weighted distribution of cohort lifespans, such that longer lifespans have proportionally greater representation. One implication is that if death rates are unchanging, the average lifespan of the current population always exceeds period life expectancy. This result connects stationary population lifespan measures to a well-developed body of statistical results; provides new intuition for established demographic results; generates new insights into the relationship between periods, cohorts, and prevalent cohorts; and offers a framework for thinking about mortality selection more broadly than the concept of demographic frailty.}

While digital data uniquely captures the totality of a person's communication, past research consistently shows that a subset of contacts makes up a person's ``social network'' of unique resource providers. To address this gap, we analyzed the correspondence between self-reported social network data and email communication data with the objective of identifying the dynamics in e-communication that correlate with a person's perception of a significant network tie. First, we examined the predictive utility of three popular methods to derive social network data from email data based on volume and reciprocity of bilateral email exchanges. Second, we observed differences in the response dynamics along self-reported ties, allowing us to introduce and test a new method that incorporates time-resolved exchange data. Using a range of robustness checks for measurement and misreporting errors in self-report and email data, we find that the methods have similar predictive utility. Although e-communication has lowered communication costs with large numbers of persons, and potentially extended our number of, and reach to contacts, our case results suggest that underlying behavioral patterns indicative of friendship or professional contacts continue to operate in a classical fashion in email interactions.}

The objectives of the study are to examine the trend of mortality decline and life expectancy. Contemporaneously, we have projected life expectancy up to 2025, projecting ASDR using Lee-Carter method. Life table aging rate (LAR) used to estimate the rate of mortality deceleration. Overtime, LAR increased and during recent decade it remained more or less unchanged. By age, LAR significant increased in the oldest of old. The slope is steepest in the oldest of old in the recent decade. The rates of mortality increased in oldest of old as the age group is more vulnerable to chronic disease and vulnerable to identifiable risk factors for virtually every disease, marked by senility. The analysis revealed that the level of mortality is not declining but rate of acceleration is declining and is further expected to decline. By the year 2025, the age specific death rates for the age group 5--9 and 10--14 will go below one per thousand.Life expectancy will attained as high as 73 and 79 years for male and female and is further expected to increase linearly. 71 percent of total female birth and 57 percent of total male birth will survive up to age 70+. Also the findings revealed that mortality rate is declining with constant rate up to age 70 and thereafter, the mortality rate accelerates and this holds true for both sexes.},

RDS recruits hidden populations more effectively than other sampling methods and promises to generate unbiased estimates of their characteristics. RDS's faithful representation of hidden populations relies on the validity of core assumptions regarding the unobserved referral process. With empirical recruitment data from an RDS study of female sex workers (FSWs) in Shanghai, we assess the RDS assumption that participants recruit nonpreferentially from among their network alters. We also present a bootstrap method for constructing the confidence intervals around RDS estimates. This approach uniquely incorporates real-world features of the population under study (e.g., the sample's observed branching structure). We then extend this approach to approximate the distribution of RDS estimates under various peer recruitment scenarios consistent with the data as a means to quantify the impact of recruitment bias and of rejection bias on the RDS estimates. We find that the hierarchical social organization of FSWs leads to recruitment biases by constraining RDS recruitment across social classes and introducing bias in the RDS estimates.},

  abstract = {Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of emerging infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of behaviour changes on epidemics can be key to improving control efforts. However, how the dynamics of individual behaviour changes affects the development of emerging infectious disease is a key public health issue. To develop different formula for individual behaviour change and introduce how to embed it into a dynamic model of infectious diseases, we choose A/H1N1 and Ebola as typical examples, combined with the epidemic reported cases and media related news reports. Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that the accumulated number of hospital notifications and deaths could be largely reduced as the rate of behaviour change increases. Therefore, in terms of mitigating emerging infectious diseases, both media publicity focused on how to guide people's behaviour change and positive responses of individuals are critical.},

We use a recent survey of Chinese international students to illustrate the use of NSUM and estimate the percentage of Buddhists (4.3 percent) and Christians (8.6 percent) in this population.

Although the relationships of both maternal health and socioeconomic characteristics to infant mortality rates are well documented, little is known about whether the social environment is associated with infant health. Moreover, few ecological studies of infant mortality in the literature have adopted a spatial approach to handle the spatial dependence embedded in the data. This study is designed to fill these gaps by connecting the concept of social capital with infant mortality in the U.S. at the county level. In so doing, it employs a spatial Poisson methodology to manage spatial dependence. The major conclusions are: (1) Though structural social capital index alone is predictive of infant health, this effect disappears when residential stability and neighborhood safety (cognitive social capital) are considered. Both could better explain why infant mortality varies by county. (2) The adverse effect of low birth weight on infant health could be attenuated by social capital and other socioeconomic conditions. (3) Our study illustrates that a spatial approach is necessary, especially for ecological studies; otherwise, spatial dependence would lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions.},

Analyzing data for counties in the contiguous United States, we find that: (1) the rural paradox is confirmed with both metro-nonmetro and rural-urban continuum codes, (2) social capital significantly reduces the impacts of residence on mortality after controlling for race and ethnicity and socioeconomic covariates, (3) this attenuation is greater when a spatial perspective is imposed on the analysis, (4) social capital is negatively associated with mortality at the county level, and (5) spatial dependence is strongly in evidence.

  abstract = {Why do humans cooperate? Lab experiments have found that cooperation may emerge in part because humans have intrinsically egalitarian motives, meaning that they resist inequality even at some personal cost. But outside the lab, economic inequality is high and on the rise, yet survey data suggest that people do not prioritize policies intended to address inequality. If people are intrinsically egalitarian, why are dramatic increases in inequality not a bigger concern? One possibility is that most people care more about unfairness than inequality per se. Here, we report the results of a networked, online experiment designed to unpack the relationship between fairness and inequality. In our experiment, we create fair and unfair wealth allocations by experimentally manipulating two factors: wealth distribution (i.e., whether starting wealth is equal vs unequal) and wealth source (i.e., the specific mechanism through which wealth (in)equality comes about, earned vs random). Our results show that the source of subjects' wealth has important effects on their attitudes and behavior: when subjects ``earned'' their endowments, they perceived their wealth regimes to be more fair, and they were less likely to cooperate. These findings suggest that it can be misleading to study inequality without accounting for subjects' understanding of how that inequality arose.},

  abstract = {Social contact patterns are a critical explanatory factor of the spread of close-contact infectious agents. Both indirect (via observed epidemiologic data) and direct (via diaries that record at-risk events) approaches to the measurement of contacts by age have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, the authors discuss the possibilities offered by time-use surveys to measure contact patterns and to explain observed seroprevalence profiles. The authors first develop a methodology to estimate time-of-exposure matrices, and then they apply it to time-use data for the United States (1987--2003). Finally, the authors estimate age-specific transmission parameters for varicella, commonly known as ``chickenpox,'' from age-specific time-of-exposure and seroprevalence data (United States, 1988--1994). The estimated time-of-exposure matrix reveals a strong element of assortativeness by age. In addition, there are peaks of exposure between people who were born one generation apart (i.e., parents and their children). Models based on the estimated age-specific transmission parameters fit the observed patterns of infection of endemically circulating varicella in a satisfactory way. The availability of time-use data for a large number of countries and their potential to supplement contact surveys make the methods developed extremely valuable and suitable for implementation in several different contexts.},

However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race/ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the US coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Methods.{$\quad$} We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. Results.{$\quad$} In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than for Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 (agestandardized incidence, 1626/100 000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate, 244/100 000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95\% posterior credible interval [CrI], 5.4--5.6) and 6.7 (95\% CrI, 6.4--7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. Conclusions.{$\quad$} This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community, and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.},

Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models---and, by consequence, modelers---guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as ``equal opportunity infectors'' despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Who and what next? The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought tighter restrictions on the daily lives of millions of people, but we do not yet understand what measures are the most effective. Zhang et al. modeled virus transmission in Wuhan, China, in February 2020, investigating the effects of interventions ranging from patient management to social isolation. Age-mixing patterns were estimated by contact surveys conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai at the beginning of February 2020. Once people reduced their average daily contacts from 14 to 20 down to 2, transmission rapidly fell below the epidemic threshold. The model also showed that preemptive school closures helped to reduce transmission, although alone they would not prevent a COVID-19 outbreak. Limiting human mixing to within households appeared to be the most effective measure. Science, this issue p. 1481 Intense nonpharmaceutical interventions were put in place in China to stop transmission of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact survey data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact-tracing information from Hunan province. Daily contacts were reduced seven- to eightfold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0 to 14 years of age are less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than adults 15 to 64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95\% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.49), whereas individuals more than 65 years of age are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95\% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.92). Based on these data, we built a transmission model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on transmission. We find that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. Although proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they can reduce peak incidence by 40 to 60\% and delay the epidemic. Reducing social contacts on the scale achieved in Wuhan and Shanghai in early 2020 could be sufficient to bring a COVID-19 outbreak under control.

  abstract = {Background: The disease burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not uniform across occupations. Although healthcare workers are well-known to be at increased risk, data for other occupations are lacking. In lieu of this, models have been used to forecast occupational risk using various predictors, but no model heretofore has used data from actual case numbers. This study assesses the differential risk of COVID-19 by occupation using predictors from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database and correlating them with case counts published by the Washington State Department of Health to identify workers in individual occupations at highest risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods: The O*NET database was screened for potential predictors of differential COVID-19 risk by occupation. Case counts delineated by occupational group were obtained from public sources. Prevalence by occupation was estimated and correlated with O*NET data to build a regression model to predict individual occupations at greatest risk. Results: Two variables correlate with case prevalence: disease exposure (r = 0.66; p = 0.001) and physical proximity (r = 0.64; p = 0.002), and predict 47.5\% of prevalence variance (p = 0.003) on multiple linear regression analysis. The highest risk occupations are in healthcare, particularly dental, but many nonhealthcare occupations are also vulnerable. Conclusions: Models can be used to identify workers vulnerable to COVID-19, but predictions are tempered by methodological limitations. Comprehensive data across many states must be collected to adequately guide implementation of occupationspecific interventions in the battle against COVID-19.},

Understanding the likely pathways for their emergence and spread requires knowledge on human-human and human-animal contacts, but such studies are rare. We used self-completed and interviewer-completed contact diaries to quantify patterns of these contacts for 965 individuals in 2017/2018 in a high-income densely-populated area of China, Shanghai City. Interviewer-completed diaries recorded more social contacts (19.3 vs. 18.0) and longer social contact duration (35.0 vs. 29.1\,hours) than self-reporting. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups especially among young participants (aged 7--20) and middle aged participants (25--55 years). 17.7\% of participants reported touching animals (15.3\% (pets), 0.0\% (poultry) and 0.1\% (livestock)). Human-human contact was very frequent but contact with animals (especially poultry) was rare although associated with frequent human-human contact. Hence, this densely populated area is more likely to act as an accelerator for human-human spread but less likely to be at the source of a zoonosis outbreak. We also propose that telephone interview at the end of reporting day is a potential improvement of the design of future contact surveys.},

First, the CAS sample characteristics were compared with the 2002 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS, response rate 77\%) and the 2001 Canada Census data. Second, characteristics of early and late respondents were compared.{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$} {$<$}AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS"{$>$}People with lowest income and less than high-school education and those who never married were under-represented in the CAS compared with the Census, but similar to the CCHS. Substance use was more prevalent in the CAS than the CCHS sample, but most of the CAS and CCHS estimates did not exceed +/-3\% points. Late respondents were also significantly more likely to be male, young adult, highly educated, used, have high income, live in different provinces and report substance use. Multivariate logistic regression found significant non-response bias for lifetime, past 12 months, chronic risky, acute risky and heavy monthly alcohol use, lifetime and past year cannabis use, lifetime hallucinogen use, any illicit drug uses of lifetime and past year. Adjustment for non-response bias substantially increased prevalence estimates. For example, the estimates for lifetime and past 12 month illicit drug use increased by 5.22\% and 10.34\%.{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$} {$<$}AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"{$>$}It is concluded that non-response bias is a significant problem in substance use surveys with low response rates but that some adjustments can be made to compensate.{$<$}/AbstractText{$>$}},

  abstract = {Lockdown and social distancing restrictions have been widely used as part of policy efforts aimed at controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Since these restrictions have a negative impact on the economy, there exists a strong incentive to relax these policies while protecting public health. Using a modified SEIR epidemiological model, this paper explores the costs and benefits associated with the sequential release of specific groups based on age and risk from lockdown and social distancing measures. The results in this paper suggest that properly designed staggered-release policies can do better than simultaneous-release policies in terms of protecting the most vulnerable members of a population, reducing health risks overall, and increasing economic activity.},

  abstract = {Networks---sets of objects connected by relationships---are important in a number of fields. The study of networks has long been central to sociology, where researchers have attempted to understand the causes and consequences of the structure of relationships in large groups of people. Using insight from previous network research, Killworth et al. and McCarty et al. have developed and evaluated a method for estimating the sizes of hard-to-count populations using network data collected from a simple random sample of Americans. In this article we show how, using a multilevel overdispersed Poisson regression model, these data also can be used to estimate aspects of social structure in the population. Our work goes beyond most previous research on networks by using variation, as well as average responses, as a source of information. We apply our method to the data of McCarty et al. and find that Americans vary greatly in their number of acquaintances. Further, Americans show great variation in propensity to form ties to people in some groups (e.g., males in prison, the homeless, and American Indians), but little variation for other groups (e.g., twins, people named Michael or Nicole). We also explore other features of these data and consider ways in which survey data can be used to estimate network structure.}

  abstract = {Relationships among socio-demographic characteristics, general assessments of health, and old-age mortality have been well established in developed countries. There is also increasing focus on the connection between early-life experiences and late-life health. This study tests these and other associations using representative survey data from Taiwan. Survey data on the 60 and over population (N=4049) in 1989, 1993, and 1996 are linked to 1989--1999 data from a national death registry. Survival is modeled using Gompertz regression and both fixed and time-varying covariates. Possible effects of Taiwan's Universal Health Insurance Program are tested by coding observations as pre- or post-insurance. Some results replicate findings from developed countries; others are new. Contemporaneous education effects on survival are attenuated after introducing some indicators of health from a previous period. Functional and global assessments of health have stronger associations with survival than reports of other health-related characteristics. Mainlanders have higher survival than others. Increases in survival over the 1990s were concentrated among those with the greatest number and severity of functional limitations. This pattern may be an indication of better access to health care or changes in longer-run, but unmeasured, determinants of old-age mortality.},
